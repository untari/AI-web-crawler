The administrations of these regions have completed all the preparatory work. According to Mussin, the remaining regions will receive their equipment from the next batch, which is expected to arrive in ten days. In 20 days, 2,000 remote rural schools in the country will receive 2,000 sets providing high-speed internet.  Starlink, a high-speed satellite internet operated by the American SpaceX aerospace company, will provide a stable and fast connection for remote and rural areas, allowing students and teachers to use modern digital educational resources."},

Hyrasia Energy, a subsidiary of Svevind, a German-Swedish company, will oversee the production of green hydrogen and its derivatives (ammonia). Ainur Tumysheva, the director of Investments at Hyrasia Energy, emphasized the environmental benefits of green hydrogen production, which involves no emissions when generated from solar or wind energy sources. “Hydrogen itself is stored either in liquid or gas form and is utilized across all energy-intensive industries, including metalworking, the production of construction materials, fertilizers, and food products. Any process that requires a large amount of electricity uses either hydrogen, ammonia, or methane, which are derivatives of hydrogen,” she said. The project will include the construction of infrastructure, including wind and solar power plants, roads, power lines, transformer stations, and other facilities. Several clusters for electricity generation will be built across different areas of the region. The industrial park in the Karakiya district near the Kuryk village will house essential facilities such as a water demineralization plant, an electrolysis plant, and an ammonia synthesis plant.  “All productions will be constructed simultaneously, including wind turbines and solar panels. The project aims to obtain 70% of electricity from wind and 30% from solar,” said Tumysheva. She further detailed the project’s development, noting the installation of meteorological masts imported from Europe in August 2022. These masts, currently situated in various regions of the area, continuously provide data including wind direction, density, speed, and circulation. “Using this data, we are engaged in developing engineering documentation to determine the precise placement of each turbine. The balancing act is crucial due to the variable nature of alternative energy sources. Therefore, we are structuring the technical process to ensure a consistent flow of electricity,” she said. Land surveys are currently in progress, to be followed by the acquisition of permits and licenses to ensure compliance with Kazakh and international standards for technological and environmental safety, a process expected to take approximately three years. “If the current project development pace is maintained, construction of the initial phase is anticipated to commence in 2027, with large-scale production expected to start by 2030,” Tumysheva stated.  She noted a global trend toward green hydrogen, with many countries transitioning to renewable energy sources, though a significant global market is anticipated only by 2030. Tumysheva highlighted forecasts from the International Energy Agency, which indicate a projected demand of approximately 100 million tons of green hydrogen by 2030. The production capacity in Mangystau is expected to reach two million tons annually. Initially, production will be export-oriented, with efforts underway to identify potential consumers within Kazakhstan. Tumysheva highlighted the impending carbon taxes in various countries, including the European Union, the United States, Korea, Japan, and China, underscoring the necessity for producers to adopt green energy resources for future exports. Addressing the issue of water usage in production, particularly significant in the context of declining Caspian Sea levels, Tumysheva mentioned that this aspect is under thorough examination. A two-year analysis is being conducted by specialists from a German engineering company and Kazakh ecologists, focusing on the environmental impact on the Caspian Sea. Tumysheva stressed that final engineering documentation on water usage is essential to proceed with the project. As per the signed investment agreement between Svevind and the Kazakh government, the company is obligated to create jobs for Kazakh citizens. “According to the agreements, 90% of all employees must be Kazakh citizens. Achieving 100% localization is challenging due to the industry’s novelty. Technology and knowledge transfer from foreign specialists will be necessary,” said Tumysheva.  Last summer, German Federal President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited Aktau to  launch  test drilling at a major green hydrogen production plant and endorse the Kazakhstan-German Institute of Sustainable Engineering Sciences. Graduates from this institute are expected to contribute to the project’s workforce. Preliminary estimates suggest that 1,800 jobs will be created."},

Photo credit: National Bank of Kazakhstan press service", "content": "ASTANA — National Bank Chairman Timur Suleimenov announced that the bank’s Monetary Policy Committee reduced the base rate to 14.75% on Feb. 23, the bank’s press service reported. In a press statement, Suleimenov noted that one of the pivotal factors driving this decision is the trajectory of annual inflation, which is exhibiting a deceleration despite a diminishing rate, aligning closely with projected trends.  According to the bank’s statement, household inflation expectations have seen a consecutive decline over the past three months, signaling a positive trend. However, indicators reflecting the stable component of inflation have accelerated, underscoring the necessity for sustained efforts to maintain price stability. Despite these encouraging developments, the economy continues to grapple with pro-inflationary pressures stemming from robust consumer demand, fiscal stimulus initiatives, and persistent inflation expectations. The global inflation rates are on a downward trend, sustained by contractionary monetary policies in various countries and declining energy and food prices. However, the statement noted that logistical challenges in certain regions and pockets of inflation acceleration in Russia and China raise concerns. Suleimenov said that monitoring key indicators such as domestic demand, inflation expectations, fiscal policy uncertainties, and external economic conditions underscores the importance of maintaining moderately tight monetary conditions.  “The primary objective remains steadfast: achieving a confident reduction of inflation to 5% within the medium term,” Suleimenov said in the statement.  According to the bank’s forecasts, inflation rates for this year are expected to be between 7.5% and 9.5%, while projections for 2025 stand at 5.5% to 7.5%. By 2026, inflation is anticipated to stabilize within the 5-6% range, moving closer to the target threshold. However, risks to these forecasts persist, including uncertainties surrounding fiscal policy parameters, ongoing fiscal stimuli, inflationary pressures amidst unanchored expectations, and the possibility of increased sanctions against Kazakhstan’s principal trading partners. The bank’s forecasts regarding economic growth for Kazakhstan have been revised upwards for 2024 to 3.5%-4.5% and maintained for 2025 at 5.5%-6.5%.  The anticipated growth in 2024 is attributed to domestic demand dynamics amid improving business sentiment, while 2025 is expected to witness higher growth driven by government initiatives and increased oil production at Tengizchevroil (TCO).  In 2026, economic growth is projected at 3.5%-4.5%, contingent upon various factors including oil price fluctuations and current forecast assumptions. “It is imperative to note that these forecasts are grounded in the socio-economic development forecast of Kazakhstan and other pertinent government program documents. However, ongoing policy formulation efforts by the government and related bodies to bolster economic growth may necessitate revisions to both inflation and GDP forecasts as these measures take effect,” Suleimenov said."},
