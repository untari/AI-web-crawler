    "long_article1 = \"Markets Fear & Greed Index Latest Market News The US economy notched another solid month of job growth, with an added lift from actors and autoworkers coming off the picket lines. Employers added 199,000 jobs in November, and the unemployment rate dipped to 3.7% from 3.9% the month before, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data released Friday. “The economy’s still humming along,” Jane Oates, a former Department of Labor official who now is CEO of employment education nonprofit WorkingNation, told CNN. “For the past two weeks, all we’ve heard is doom and gloom about how this is going to be a terrible day. And it was a much better day than was predicted.” Economists were expecting net job gains of 180,000 for the month and for the unemployment rate to hold steady, according to Refinitiv. The labor force participation rate ticked up 0.1 percentage points to 62.8%, returning to its highest level since the onset of the pandemic. The participation rate increase is a “positive underlying context to the unemployment rate decline,” wrote Daniel Zhao, Glassdoor’s lead economist, in commentary issued Friday. The largest employment gains last month came in health care and government, which added an estimated 93,200 and 49,000 jobs, respectively. Manufacturing saw a boost, too, largely because of thereturn of striking autoworkers, which lifted motor vehicles and parts employment by 30,000 jobs. Additionally, the resolution of the Screen Actors Guild strike against Hollywood studios resulted in 17,200 jobs added in the motion picture and sound recording industries. In total, the BLS was anticipating a net gain of 35,000 workers returning after strikes: Theagency estimatedthat 61,000 workers were absent from the labor market due to labor disputes, versus 96,000 the month before. Taking into account those one-time gains, the underlying rate of job growth is likely around 160,000 jobs per month, which aligns with the 2019 average, wrote Julia Pollak, senior economist with ZipRecruiter. November’s jobs number is in line with the strong monthly gains hit in the decade before the pandemic, when 183,000 jobs per month were added. The current rate of job growth also is well above the “neutral rate,” or what’s needed to keep up with population growth. “It is critical to put this data in the proper context,” Joseph Brusuelas, principal and chief economist of RSM US, wrote in a note on Friday. “Given long-term demographic changes and structural transformation of the US economy to keep employment stable, only 75,000 jobs per month need to be created, in contrast with the roughly 200,000 that was the case just over a decade ago.” The biggest declines occurred in the retail trade and temporary help services sectors, which lost 38,400 jobs and 13,600 jobs, respectively. “The [reason for the] reduction of jobs in retail is very similar to the reduction of jobs in other places, except retail hasn’t been able to absorb — and that’s technology,” Oates said. As e-commerce and in-store pick-ups become more engrained in how people shop, that leads to fewer people needed at the brick-and-mortar level. November’s job growth was stronger thanOctober’s unrevised tally of 150,000 jobs added. September’s job gains were revised down to 262,000 from 297,000, according to the BLS. The continued strength in the labor market has helped fuel consumer spending and economic growth, but Federal Reserve officials believe slower demand (and slower wage growth) will help bring down inflation. Friday’s jobs report showed that average hourly earnings rose 0.4% in November from the month before, showing a more accelerated pace of growth than the 0.2% uptick seen in October and the 0.3% expected by economists. Fed Chair Powell: Too early to say when to expect rate cuts On an annual basis, however, wage gains eased to 4% from the 4.1% rate seen a month before. Through November, the economy has added an average of 232,000 jobs per month — far more moderate growth than 2022 and 2021, when an estimated 399,000 and 606,000 jobs were added every month, respectively. Friday’s strong jobs report likely keeps the Fed’s options open, although cooling inflation should mean that another pause is in store when the central bank meets next week, wrote Lydia Boussour, EY senior economist. “Labor market endurance will lead Fed officials to retain some optionality for future rate hikes, if needed,” she wrote. “We expect policymakers will resist talking about rate cuts until early 2024.” Most stock quote data provided by BATS.

Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 199,000 for the month, slightly better than the 190,000 Dow Jones estimate and ahead of the unrevised October gain of 150,000, the Labor Department reported Friday. The numbers were boosted by sizeable gains in government hiring as well as workers returning from strikes in the auto and entertainment industries. The unemployment rate declined to 3.7%, compared with the forecast for 3.9%, as the labor force participation rate edged higher to 62.8%. A more encompassing unemployment rate that includes discouraged workers and those holding part-time positions for economic reasons fell to 7%, a decline of 0.2 percentage point. \"\"The job market continues to be resilient after a year of dodging recession fears,\"\" said Daniel Zhao, lead economist at job ratings site Glassdoor. \"\"Really the one concern that we had coming in today's report was the recent rise in the unemployment rate. So the improvement in unemployment was a welcome relief.\"\" The department's survey of households, used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed much more robust job growth of 747,000 and an addition of 532,000 workers to the labor force. Average hourly earnings, a key inflation indicator, increased by 0.4% for the month and 4% from a year ago. The monthly increase was slightly ahead of the 0.3% estimate, but the yearly rate was in line. Markets showed mixed reaction to the report, with stock market futures modestly negative while Treasury yields surged. \"\"What we wanted was a strong but moderating labor market, and that's what we saw in the November report,\"\" said Robert Frick, corporate economist with Navy Federal Credit Union, noting \"\"healthy job growth, lower unemployment, and decent wage increases. All this points to the labor market reaching a natural equilibrium around 150,000 jobs [per month] next year, which is plenty to continue the expansion, and not enough to trigger a Fed rate hike.\"\" Health care was the biggest growth industry, adding 77,000 jobs. Other big gainers included government (49,000), manufacturing (28,000), and leisure and hospitality (40,000). Heading into the holiday season, retail lost 38,000 jobs, half of which came from department stores. Transportation and warehousing also showed a decline of 5,000. Duration of unemployment fell sharply, dropping to an average 19.4 weeks, the lowest level since February. The report comes at a critical time for the U.S. economy. Though growth defied widespread expectations for a recession this year, most economists expect a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter and tepid gains in 2024. Gross domestic product is on pace to rise at just a 1.2% annualized pace in the fourth quarter, according to an Atlanta Fed data gauge, and most economists expect growth of around 1% in 2024. Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as they continue to try to bring down inflation that had been running at a four-decade high but has shown signs of easing. Futures markets pricing strongly points to the Fed halting its rate-hiking campaign and beginning to cut next year, though central bank officials have been more circumspect about what lies ahead. Pricing had been pointing to the first reduction happening in March, though that swung following the jobs report, pushing a higher probability for the first expected cut now to May. The Fed will hold its two-day policy meeting next week, its last of the year, and investors will be looking for clues about how officials view the economy. Policymakers have been aiming to bring the economy in for a soft landing that likely would feature modest growth, a sustainable pace of wage increases and inflation at least receding back to the Fed's 2% target. Consumers hold the key to the U.S. economy, and by most measures they've held up fairly well. Retail sales fell 0.1% in October but were still up 2.5% from the previous year. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation, so they indicate that consumers at least have nearly kept pace with higher prices. A gauge the Fed uses showed inflation running at a 3.5% annual rate in October, excluding food and energy prices. However, there is some worry that the end of Covid-era stimulus payments and the continued pressure from higher interest rates could eat into spending. Net household wealth fell by about $1.3 trillion in the third quarter to about $151 trillion, owing largely to declines in the stock market, according to Fed data released this week. Household debt rose 2.5%, close to the pace where it has been for the past several quarters. Fed officials have been watching wage data closely. Rising prices tend to feed into wages, potentially creating a spiral that can be difficult to control. Don't miss these stories from CNBC PRO: Got a confidential news tip? We want to hear from you.

    "long_article4 = \"Employment Friday’s report from the Labor Department showed that the unemployment rate dropped from 3.9% to 3.7%, not far above a five-decade low of 3.4% in April. American employers added nearly 200,000 jobs in November, bolstering optimism that the nation might avoid a recession in its fight against inflation. | Kena Betancur/Getty Images ByAssociated Press 12/08/2023 09:03 AM EST Link Copied The nation’s employers added a solid 199,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate fell, fresh signs that the economy could achieve an elusive “soft landing,” in which inflation would return to the Federal Reserve’s 2% target without causing a steep recession. Friday’s report from the Labor Department showed that the unemployment rate dropped from 3.9% to 3.7%, not far above a five-decade low of 3.4% in April. The November job gain was a reminder that many employers continue to hire, though last month’s increase was inflated by the return of about 40,000 formerly striking auto workers and actors, who were not at work in October but returned in November. Still, the job market is gradually decelerating along the lines that Fed officials have wanted to see. The Fed has raised its key short-term rate from near zero to about 5.4%, a 22-year peak, leading to higher borrowing rates for consumers and businesses and lower inflation. Despite that headwind, the economy and the job market are still expanding. Layoffs remain historically low. When the Fed meets next week, it is considered sure to keep its benchmark rate unchanged for the third straight time in light of the easing inflation pressures. Most economists and Wall Street traders think the Fed’s next move will be to cut rates, though that might not happen until the second half of 2024. Even modest hiring helps ensure that consumers, who drive most of the economy’s growth, keep spending. Early reports on holiday shopping showed healthy growth in online sales. Many of the most recent economic figures have been encouraging. Companies areadvertising fewer job openings, and Americans are switching jobs less often than they did a year ago, trends that typically slow wage growth and inflation pressures. Hiring is cooling, and price increases have moderated significantly. Still, the number of people receiving unemployment aid, though still low,has risen. And for much of this year, hiring has been concentrated in just a few sectors — notably health care, restaurants and hotels and government — rather than broadly across the economy. Hiring has been cooling as the Fed’s sharp interest rate hikes have raised borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, depressing sales of homes, cars, appliances and other high-priced purchases and investments. For now, most analysts are offering a positive outlook of slower but still steady growth and easing inflation. The economy is expected to expand at a modest 1.5% annual rate in the final three months of this year, down froma scorching 5.2% pace in the July-September quarter. Cooler growth should help bring down inflation while still supporting a modest pace of hiring. The economy is still growing even after the Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times, from near zero in March 2022. The aggressive pace of those hikes has made mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing much more expensive. At the same time, inflation has tumbled from apeak of 9.1% in June 2022tojust 3.2% last month. And according to a different inflation measure that the Fed prefers, prices rose at just a 2.5% annual rate in the past six months — not far below the central bank’s target. Such progress has fueled speculation in the financial markets that the Fed could soon cut its benchmark rate, perhaps as early as March. Wall Street traders now expect five rate cuts next year, according to futures prices tracked byCME FedWatch. Most economists envision fewer. Christopher Waller, a key Fed official who typically favors higher rates,buoyed the markets’ expectations last weekwhen he suggested that if inflation kept falling, the Fed could cut rates as early as spring. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, though, pushed back against such speculationlast Friday, when he said it was “premature to conclude” that the Fed has raised its benchmark rate high enough to quell inflation. And it was too soon, he added, to “speculate” about when the Fed might cut rates. But Powell also said interest rates are “well into” restrictive territory, meaning that they’re clearly constraining growth. Many analysts took that remark as a signal that the Fed is done raising rates. Link Copied © 2023 POLITICO LLC\"\n",

Nonfarm payrolls rose by a seasonally adjusted 199,000 for the month, slightly better than the 190,000 Dow Jones estimate. The numbers were boosted by sizeable gains in government hiring as well as workers returning from strikes in the auto and entertainment industries. The unemployment rate fell despite signs of a weakening economy. The job market continues to be resilient after a year of dodging recession fears. Average hourly earnings, a key inflation indicator, increased by 0.4% for the month and 4% from a year ago. The department's survey of households, used to calculate the unemployment rate, showed much more robust job growth. Health care was the biggest growth industry, adding 77,000 jobs. Heading into the holiday season, retail lost 38,000 Jobs, half of which came from department stores. Duration of unemployment fell sharply, dropping to an average 19.4 weeks, the lowest level since February. Most economists expect a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter and tepid gains in 2024. Federal Reserve officials are watching the jobs numbers closely as they continue to try to bring down inflation. Futures markets pricing strongly points to the Fed halting its rate-hiking campaign and beginning to cut next year. Retail sales fell 0.1% in October but were still up 2.5% from the previous year. The numbers are not adjusted for inflation, so they indicate that consumers at least have nearly kept pace with higher prices. Net household wealth fell by about $1.3 trillion in the third quarter. Household debt rose 2.5%, close to the pace where it has been for the past several quarters. Fed officials have been watching wage data closely.

      "American employers added nearly 200,000 jobs in November, bolstering optimism that the nation might avoid a recession in its fight against inflation. Friday’s report from the Labor Department showed that the unemployment rate dropped from 3.9% to 3.7%, not far above a five-decade low of 3.4% in April. The job market is gradually decelerating along the lines that Fed officials have wanted to see. The Fed has raised its key short-term rate from near zero to about 5.4%, a 22-year peak. Most economists and Wall Street traders think the Fed’s next move will be to cut rates. The economy is expected to expand at a modest 1.5% annual rate in the final three months of this year. Hiring has been cooling as the Fed’s sharp interest rate hikes have raised borrowing costs. Cooler growth should help bring down inflation while still supporting the economy. The Fed has raised its benchmark rate 11 times, from near zero in March 2022. The aggressive pace of those hikes has made mortgages, auto loans and business borrowing much more expensive. At the same time, inflation has tumbled from apeak of 9.1% in June 2022tojust 3.2% last month. Many analysts took that remark as a signal that the Fed is done raising rates. But Powell also said interest rates are “well into” restrictive territory, meaning that they’re clearly constraining growth. And it was too soon, he added, to “speculate” about when the Fed might cut rates.\n"

      "ASTANA – The Kazakh company Future Nft Technology limited launched a blockchain copyright protection platform dubbed Central Asian Intellectual Property Registry (CARRIP) that registers intellectual property rights and monitors transfer transactions, reported Kazinform on Jan. 31. The platform was launched at the end of 2023 and is gaining popularity among users, said company’s advisor Temirlan Tulegenov. After registering on the platform, users can upload a file and categorize it as an audio recording, a text document, a video, a photo, a drawing, or another file.    The system determines the price and users can receive the certificate with the date and time depending on the size of the file. This certificate serves as proof that users retained their intellectual property on CARRIP.    Kazakhstan has been developing its creative industries in recent years. According to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), this sector includes 14 spheres: design, art, fashion, cinema, music, media, computer graphics, education, and other areas based on intellectual activity.   “The idea of the creative economy is to monetize talents. Kazakhstan joined the international conventions and treaties in the field of intellectual property, but the intellectual property rights market requires adaptation to modern trends in the development of the creative economy,” said Tulegenov.    Blockchain technology, widely used in areas including cryptocurrencies and banking transactions, offers significant potential for protecting copyrights in intellectual property. Encryption in the blockchain controls the protection of different records preventing non-owners from copying and editing. \n",

      "ASTANA – The primary factor driving GDP growth in 2024 in Kazakhstan is expected to be domestic demand, supported by government spending on the construction of educational facilities, infrastructure projects, and the modernization of housing and communal services, said the National Bank of Kazakhstan in a written response to The Astana Times.  “Investment projects in the oil sector and other sectors of the real economy are expected to continue,” said the National Bank.  However, forecast uncertainties linger, particularly concerning oil production in 2024-2025, casting a shadow over the otherwise positive economic outlook.  In September 2023, Chevron, operating Kazakhstan’s giant Tengizchevroil field, announced a delay in its Tengiz Future Growth Project, which some international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, said might be a reason for downward economic projections. This was also the reason driving the downward revision by the National Bank to 3.2-4.2% in 2024. “Economic growth was expected in the range of 4.2-5.2% in 2023. The GDP growth statistics for the previous year have not yet been published, but preliminary estimates, the so-called short-term economic indicator, demonstrate a GDP growth of 5.1% for the past year, which is generally within our forecast,” said the National Bank.  2023 saw a positive dynamic of economic activity, propelled by robust growth across key sectors.  “Against the background of increased production of crude oil and gas condensate, there is a growth in production volumes in the mining industry,” said the bank.  The government meeting on Feb. 5 reported that economic growth  reached  5.1% in 2023. The data also indicates construction grew by 13.3%, trade by 11.3%, information and communication services by 7.1%, transportation services by 6.9%, and the industrial sector by 4.3%. Inflation stands at 9.5% as of January, down from 20.7% in January last year. The medium-term target that the central regulator set is near 5%.  “As part of inflation targeting with a freely floating exchange rate, the National Bank of Kazakhstan employs the key instrument of monetary policy – the base rate – aiming for a gradual reduction and stabilization of inflation. Rate decisions will be made based on the analysis of macroeconomic data and forecasts,” said the National Bank.  Under  the latest decision  adopted on Jan. 19, the base rate was reduced to 15.25%.  “Work will continue to improve the manageability of economic agents’ expectations through a proactive communication strategy, which will allow the market to better understand the future direction of monetary policy. As a result, a predictable environment for businesses and the public will be provided,” said the country’s central bank.  It also highlighted close cooperation with the government and other state entities is crucial. Inflation reduction is not solely the responsibility of the central bank; fiscal policies and overall economic strategies play a vital role.  Despite the reduction in the inflation rate, the National Bank is cautious of remaining risks. These include increased fiscal stimulus, non-anchoring of inflation expectations, a possible increase in food prices due to the effect of a low harvest in 2023, as well as the direct effect of an increase in tariffs for housing and communal services. “To ensure a further reduction in inflation, the National Bank will continue to take measures in the field of monetary policy. Our decisions will be consistent, transparent, and in line with the evolving macroeconomic situation,” said the regulator.  Second-tier banks in Kazakhstan fell under President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s criticism for their poor lending dynamics to the real sector. Specifically, he noted that “amid the decline in lending to the real sector, the focus of banks’ activities shifted to consumer loans.”  This, in turn, “led to an increase in risks for the financial system and to excessive borrowing by citizens,” said Tokayev in his address to the nation in September 2023.  According to the National Bank, up to 2020, the portfolio of loans issued to businesses showed multidirectional dynamics.  “The deceleration of business activity in Kazakhstan was influenced by the deterioration of the external economic environment and imposition of quarantine restrictions. At the same time, as quarantine measures weakened and economic activity recovered, the dynamics of the loan portfolio began to show growth in 2021,” it said.  As of December 2023, 46.7% of the total loan volume was loaned to businesses. The remaining 53.3% were consumer loans.  “The growth of business loans in annual terms accelerated from 8.3% year-on-year in February to 13.7% year-on-year in November 2023. The primary contribution to the growth of business loans came from loans to small business entities, which increased by 23.8% year-on-year. In November 2023, loans to medium-sized business entities increased by 3.6% year-on-year, while loans to large businesses grew by 4.6% year-on-year,” said the National Bank.  The base rate is a linchpin in Kazakhstan’s monetary policy framework, influencing inflation, interest rates, exchange rates, and overall economic stability.  According to the National Bank, decisions on the base rate are made on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of macroeconomic parameters.  “This mainly pertains to the alignment of actual inflation with forecasts, the dynamics of inflation expectations, and the balance of risks in both the external sector and the domestic economy,” said the National Bank.  The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is in charge of determining the level of the base rate, and this process takes place eight times a year. “Since the second half of 2023, in the context of declining inflationary processes, we have begun a gradual reduction of the base rate. Following the results of the last three decisions in 2023 – Aug. 25, Oct. 6 and Nov. 24, the base rate was reduced by a total of 100 basis points from 16.75% to 15.75%. In 2024, as part of the January decision of the MPC, the rate reduction was continued by 50 basis points, from 15.75% to 15.25%,” said the National Bank.  As inflation continues to decelerate, the National Bank will assess the possibility of a gradual decrease in the base rate. This evaluation will consider the need to maintain moderately tight monetary conditions in the medium term to return inflation to the 5% target and anchor inflation expectations. \n",

      "ASTANA  –  The Kazakh government is optimistic about economic development in 2024, forecasting a minimum of 5.3% growth. In the past year, Kazakhstan demonstrated resilience by adapting to new conditions and achieving a robust economic growth of 5.1%, according to the Prime Minister’s press service.   In 2023, the key sectors of the country’s economy experienced positive dynamics. Construction soared by 13.3%, trade reached 11.3%, information and communication services surged by 7.1%, and industry increased by 4.3%. The transportation services, vital for Kazakhstan, demonstrated a remarkable 6.9% increase. Investments in fixed assets also surged by 13.7%. International rating agencies  continue to affirm  Kazakhstan’s sovereign rating and investment reliability. Over the first nine months of 2023, foreign direct investments (FDI) totaled $19.7 billion, with more than $11 billion allocated to non-resource sectors. This marks the second consecutive year that FDI has reached a substantial $26-$28 billion, making Kazakhstan the leading recipient of foreign investment among the  Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)  countries.  Foreign trade turnover increased by 2.2%, reaching $126 billion in the first 11 months of 2023. This positive trend contributed to a trade balance exceeding $16 billion. Notably, the non-primary exports expanded with 141 new items.  Kazakhstan’s international reserves reached $96 billion. The National Fund assets now surpass $60 billion after a $4 billion increase in 2023.  The government, the National Bank of Kazakhstan, and local executive authorities are undertaking measures to control inflation. As a result, it  has more than halved  in the past year and amounted to 9.8%. The objective for 2024 is to maintain inflation within the 6-8% range. By 2029, it is expected to double  gross domestic product  (GDP). On the way to sustainable development, the Kazakh government focuses on diversifying the economy, fostering entrepreneurship, attracting investments, and improving citizen well-being. \n",

      "Zhakazhanov, a native of the Karagandy Region, spent a significant portion of his career in the finance sector, working at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), one of the Big Four companies.  “I started my journey seven years ago. At that time, the financial industry was in the hype. I studied economics and finance. In 2012, it was one of the most popular specializations apart from the oil and gas industry,” he said in an interview with The Astana Times.  Working in finance, Zhakazhanov had a chance to try himself in data science. To broaden his practical knowledge and understanding of the field, he spent two years studying at the University of California San Diego with the support of Kazakhstan’s Bolashak scholarship program.  “I knew nothing before I started the journey,” he said with a smile on his face.  However, it was not long before he realized that data science did not captivate him. That was the moment he decided to take the plunge into product management. This choice was not just a career move, it was a profound personal journey.  Product manager is a multifaceted role that involves overseeing the development and lifecycle of a software product or service. It is a crucial function that bridges the gap between technical teams, business stakeholders, and end-users, ensuring that the product meets both customer needs and business goals. “Basically, product managers are people who understand the user needs and also have a very clear understanding of stakeholders, business owners, and investors. They have to know how to cover the needs of users and earn money for the business,” he said. The journey was not without its struggles. Zhakazhanov embraced every stumbling block as an opportunity for growth. He now boasts experience in international startups and big companies in Kazakhstan at a senior product manager level.  A culminating point in his professional journey was the creation of his own academy, called Product Bee, two years ago. It stemmed from Zhakazhanov’s genuine desire to extend a hand to those contemplating similar leaps. “The academy started by the demand of students, different specialists and switchers – people who want to switch professions. A lot of people asked me on social media. In the beginning, I tried to help them. More than 10-15 people had job offers,” he said.  So far, the academy has given 300 professionals a chance to enter the IT market. “I can say we are number one in the amount of offers in the sphere of product management and number one in terms of alumni,” he said.  The academy recently signed a deal with InDrive, an international ride-hailing service operating in 710 cities in 46 countries. The agreement entails training high school students as part of InDrive’s BeginIT social educational project. On a macro level, Kazakhstan still needs to double pace its efforts to keep up with global digital powers.  “The IT boom started around 15 years ago with the rise of Amazon, Meta, Apple, Netflix and Google. Belarus and Ukraine have made endowment funds and different practices to have their specialists trained and prepared for that wave. (…) It is one of the challenges that Kazakhstan is now a bit lagging, not for two or three years, but ten,” noted Zhakazhanov.  Another challenge is the lack of proper infrastructure, which hinders the country’s ability to prepare for the next era of artificial intelligence (AI). He emphasized AI requires hefty data centers and well-developed infrastructure.  “In the rise of AI, we can see nanochips and microchips from TSMC [Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company] and other large companies like Nvidia have been sold to mostly three countries – the United States, Singapore and China. Kazakhstan has very little nanochips purchased so far,” he said.  “If the goal is just to earn money, it is better not to transition, because the IT boom has hiring winter,” said Zhakazhanov. But if one is keen to immerse in a field, the first step will be to find a community where one can grow.  “Basically, how we transition to IT because the inner cycle of friends and friends of friends transfer, and we see success cases near each other. Talk more to friends, ask more and be curious,” he said. Patience is no less significant at the start of the journey.  Zhakazhanov noted there are many communities in Kazakhstan. The number of conferences that offer opportunities for networking is also growing. Digital Bridge in Astana, hosted by the Astana Hub, and Digital Almaty, hosted by Tech Garden, are examples.  “They are large and probably monumental events that Kazakhstan has never had before,” he added.  Zhakazhanov also pointed out the growing maturity of investors.  “Before, the understanding was that you can earn only as a top manager or a traditional entrepreneur. In the West, startup founders and CEOs show how they can earn money not in the sense of earning money, but influencing the market,” he said. Similar to every kind of relationship, the biggest challenge is communication. “Most startup founders want investment now or tomorrow, but you have to create communication first with investors and have the same vibe. They are the people who want to help you as well. They are the people with whom you walk together for part of your life. In the United States, they say an investor is more important than a wife because you are going to spend more time with them than with your partner,” he said.  Zhakazhanov highlighted the need for regional cooperation, saying it is a regional problem that countries did not help each other to prosper.  “We are not understanding our power. We only recently started working with Turkic countries as an ecosystem. Last year, we signed contracts with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan,” he said.  Speaking about regional initiatives, he mentioned the establishment of the Silk Road Innovation Hub in Silicon Valley in 2023 as a “great movement from different countries to work together,” a first of its kind in the region.  The hub supports entrepreneurs, founders, startups, and talented individuals from Central Asia, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, and Mongolia straight into Silicon Valley. “We cross-share several events like InMerge Summit in Baku and Digital Bridge in Astana. (…) Astana Hub in Kazakhstan, IT Park in Uzbekistan and Sabah incubation labs in Azerbaijan now work together to create and foster the startup movement. Even more, Uzbekistan’s Aloqa Bank invests in Kazakhstan’s startups and Kazakhstan’s ecosystem invests in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan’s startups,” he said.  Zhakazhanov’s IT academy is also open to professionals from the region.  “We are now giving scholarships and grants to Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Azerbaijan’s students. They are applying to our academy. We are trying to help not only the Kazakh market but also Central Asia and CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States] and this is how we envision our development,” said Zhakazhanov. \n",

      "ASTANA – Kazakhstan remains a key recipient of the gross foreign direct investment (FDI) from the Persian Gulf countries. Qatar’s contributions of $13.1 million constituted an impressive threefold growth in 2022. In the first three quarters of 2023, Qatari investments reached $4.4 million, reported Ranking.kz analytical website.  Since 2015, FDI inflows from Qatar to Kazakhstan have surpassed $60 million. Energy, agriculture, logistics, and manufacturing are the major areas of economic cooperation. The statistics showcase an escalating interest from Qatar and other Gulf nations in Kazakhstan. Overall, by the end of 2022, FDI  inflows  of the region reached $460.7 million, marking a substantial 26.8% increase compared to a year before. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) continues to lead in investments provided to Kazakhstan among all Persian Gulf countries.   Government measures underscore the commitment to fostering economic ties between Kazakhstan and Qatar. In October 2022, the sides agreed to intensify economic cooperation. The Mazhilis, a lower chamber of the Kazakh Parliament, ratified the document in December last year.  “The purpose of the agreement is to create favorable conditions for investment activities, stimulate the inflow of foreign direct investment, and improve the economic well-being of the contracting countries,” said Kazakh Deputy Foreign Minister Nazira Nurbayeva.  The results for the first 11 months of 2023 reveal a record-high trade turnover of $9.7 million between the two countries, which is 2.4 times higher than the previous year.  As part of the Kazakhstan-Qatar business forum in October 2023 in Doha, over 150 representatives from government entities and the private sectors of both countries addressed new projects in the key sectors, according to the Kazakh Invest national company. The event announced the establishment of the Kazakhstan-Qatar Chamber of Commerce and Industry.  Kazakhstan and Qatar are collaborating on investment programs, including a $200 million grain processing plant in the Akmola Region. In addition, Kazakhstan’s Baiterek national management holding, Qatar’s Power International Holding, and China’s International Capital Corporation are considering establishing a direct investment fund to develop a dairy cluster and the entire agro-industrial compl ex.  Qatar is a major hub for international air travel and a key exporter of oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and fertilizers. In 2021, the country was the world’s third-largest exporter of natural gas and the world’s second-largest exporter of liquefied  natural gas  (LNG). Most of Qatar’s natural gas exports went to markets in Asia and Europe, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration 2023 report.\n",

Nearly one million tons of oil were transported along the Middle Corridor in 2023. The country plans to transport 1.5 million tons of oil this year. The Kazakh government prioritizes energy  opportunities, focusing on enhancing the oil and gas industry, modernizing the electricity infrastructure and increasing renewable energy capacity. The oil industry continues implementing large expansion projects at the Tengiz, Karachaganak, and Kashagan fields.  The throughput capacity of Kazakhstan’s section of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) was increased from 54 million tons to 72.5 million tons per year. Work is underway to expand the Shymkent oil refinery and increase its capacity from six to 12 million tons per year, which will fully meet the needs of the domestic fuel and lubricants market. The construction is underway at new gas processing plants in Kashagan, Karachaganak and Zhanaozen. According to the report, construction of the Butadiene petrochemical project, which is worth $1 billion, will begin this year. The Atyrau and Aktobe Regions implement projects to produce polyethylene, polyethylene terephthalate and carbamide worth $13.7 billion. Kazakhstan commissioned the Aksai South, Anabay and large Rozhkovskoye  gas fields last year with more than 31 billion cubic meters of recoverable reserves. The country plans to  launch a few more gas projects soon, including Urikhtau Central in the Aktobe Region, Western Prorva in the Atyrau Region, and Kalamkas in the Mangystau Region  with recoverable reserves of 69 billion cubic meters of gas.\n",

      "Leading US analyst Paul Krugman, who won the 2008 Nobel Prize for Economics, said there is “widespread skepticism” about China’s official GDP growth of 5.2% last year and that the Chinese economy seems to be stumbling and suffering the sort of deflation Japan endured in recent decades, according to a commentary published in the New York Times on Thursday. official GDP growth of 5.2% last year Krugman said President Xi Jinping was “starting to look like a poor economic manager” as his habit of “arbitrary interventions” had stifled private initiative, but he noted that it had been clear for a long time that China’s economic model was becoming unsustainable, because of its very low consumer spending. He said Beijing needed to allow more income to flow through to households and boost the social safety net so consumers don’t feel so compelled to hoard cash. Read the full report: The New York Times.

      "Disruptions to shipping going through the Suez Canal have lead to a surge in air cargo from Asia to Europe. Companies that normally ship clothing exports from Vietnam to Europe are opting for more expensive air freight because of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea, freight platform Xeneta said on Friday. attacks on vessels in the Red Sea Xeneta Cargo volumes from Vietnam to Europe surged 62% in the week ending January 14 from the previous week, and rates increased by 10%, Niall van de Wouw, chief air freight officer for the air and ocean freight rate benchmarking platform, said.   “This is the first signal in Xeneta data that the Red Sea crisis is impacting air freight. This is typically a quieter time of year for air freight, so to see increases of this magnitude, with higher volumes than at any point in 2023, is significant,” van de Wouw said. The Red Sea, which leads to the Suez canal, lies on the key east-west trade route from Asia’s manufacturing hubs to Europe and onto the east coast of the Americas. About 12% of world shipping traffic accesses the Suez Canal via its waters. More manufacturers are seeking to transport their products by air in the next few weeks as attacks by Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group on vessels force them to find alternate routes, logistics firms have said. Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi group Freight companies have been securing more air cargo space and some customers have begun shipping goods wholly or partially by air to avoid delays. The volume sent by air on the Vietnam-Europe route in the week ending last Sunday was 6% higher than 2023’s peak week in October, and 16% more than the same week a year ago, van de Wouw said. “In the next two weeks we should know for sure if this represents a genuine and significant shift from ocean to air freight due to the Red Sea crisis,” he said.

      "The world’s biggest bank has agreed to pay over $32 million in penalties for unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and failure to comply with US anti-money laundering rules in recent years. The US Federal Reserve said on Friday that the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) – estimated last year to have $5,669 billion in total assets – and its New York branch would pay $32.4 million in penalties. US Federal Reserve said on Friday The Fed said joint action, taken with New York’s Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), came after the bank disclosed information to a third party without regulatory approval. NYDFS said in a separate statement that an ICBC employee disclosed that supervisory information to a foreign regulator, and that the order resolved “numerous” compliance failures, including multiple deficiencies in the New York branch’s anti-money laundering programme from 2018 through 2022.

US, Chinese financial officials agree to meet again Meanwhile, in related news, meetings between US Treasury and Chinese financial officials in Beijing this week concluded with both sides agreeing to continue to meet regularly, the Treasury Department said on Friday. Treasury Department said US officials also indicated that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen looked forward to a return visit to China at an “appropriate time,” the department said in a statement. The meeting of the Financial Working Group included discussions on financial stability and capital markets issues, international financial institutions, sustainable finance, cross-border payments and data and efforts to fight money laundering and financing of terrorism. “US officials also frankly raised areas of disagreement during the conversations,” the Treasury said, without identifying these points of contention. The two sides also reviewed previous exchanges on climate stress testing and frameworks for resolving global systemically important banks in each country. The Financial Working Group and a parallel Economic Working Group were established in September 2023 after Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen visited Beijing to re-establish economic communications with her Chinese counterparts. The groups last met in San Francisco in November ahead of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit, where Yellen also met with her Chinese counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng and agreed to “intensify communication.” He also invited her to return to China this year. The members of the financial group, led on the US side by Assistant Secretary for international finance Brent Neiman and Undersecretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang, also met with He in Beijing, the Treasury said.

      "A forecast by the world’s largest contract chipmaker, TSMC, that demand for high-end artificial intelligence (AI) semiconductors would bump up its revenue by more than 20% in 2024, triggered a blistering chip rally across Asia on Friday. Semiconductor-related stocks saw a day of up-moves across key Asian markets, including Japan, South Korea, India and Taiwan, on the back of similar overnight gains on Wall Street. China, however, gave the fireworks a miss as the country’s economic concerns continued to cloud over its beaten-down stock market. economic concerns   In Japan, the chip rally single-handedly set the Nikkei share average back on track for a second consecutive weekly advance. Heavyweight Nikkei stocks Tokyo Electron and Advantest were the biggest points gainers, advancing 5.05% and 7.92% respectively. Precision machinery — essential for higher yields and lower production costs in the chipmaking process — was the top performer among the Tokyo Stock Exchange’s 33 industry groups, rising 2.62%. The 1.4% bounce in the Nikkei was only outdone by the more than 2.6% jump in Taiwan, home to TSMC. TSMC’s shares closed 6.5% higher on Friday in Taipei, cementing its position as Asia’s most valuable listed company, worth about $512 billion. That was after the chipmaker’s New York-listed shares saw a blockbuster run overnight, surging close to 10% and ending with a market capitalisation of $586.22 billion. TSMC’s revenue projection also sparked a rally in American chip-related stocks on Thursday. Heavyweight chipmaker Nvidia and AMD rose 1.9% and 1.6%, respectively and notched record highs. Barron’s noted that Nvidia, the US’ most valuable chip firm, was on track to hit a market cap of more than $1.4 trillion for the first time ever. Barron’s noted Other US chipmakers, Broadcom, Qualcomm and Marvell Technology gained more than 3% each. The Philadelphia SE semiconductor index saw an overall rally of 3.4%. “AI has caused this industry to have a ‘rip your face off’ rally, and I don’t think it’s stopping anytime soon,” Jake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, said.  ‘Technological revolution’ A major Apple and Nvidia supplier, TSMC doubled down on its bets on an AI chip boom, despite a broader slowdown in the semiconductor industry due to weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales. “We are a key enabler for AI applications. So far today, everything you saw for AI comes from TSMC,” the chipmaker’s CEO CC Wei said, after the company reported a fourth-quarter net profit that beat market expectations. He said the current quarter would be impacted by seasonality of the smartphone business, which would be partially offset by strength in its high-performance computing segment that includes AI chips. “With basic semiconductors – that’s a supply and demand business… but I think you’re going to continue to hear chatter about AI, and it will translate into huge revenue growth for a lot of these companies,” Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls &amp; Snyder in New York, said. “To me, we’re in the early stages still of a technological revolution.”  Reuters, with additional inputs from Vishakha Saxena         Vishakha Saxena is the Multimedia and Social Media Editor at Asia Financial.

      "Officials in China’s most indebted provinces and cities have been told to delay, downsize or stop work on state-funded transport infrastructure, sources say. The order from the State Council comes amid efforts by Beijing to ease risks from the massive $13 trillion of municipal debt accumulated by the country’s 30 or so provinces over the past decade or more. The State Council issued a directive to local governments and state banks to delay or halt construction on projects with less than half the planned investment completed in 12 regions across the country, three sources said.   Beijing has been tightening curbs on debt in recent months to defuse risks to the world’s second-largest economy and its financial stability, while also trying to stimulate growth that has long relied on infrastructure investments by local governments.  Expressways, airports and rail links affected Infrastructure targeted in the latest directive, which has not been previously reported, includes expressways, airport reconstruction and expansion, and urban rail projects, one source said. Some projects, such as those approved by the central government or for affordable housing, are exempt, two sources said. The sources asked not to be identified as the directive was confidential.The State Council Information Office, which handles media queries for the council, China’s cabinet, did not respond to a request for comment. In October news emerged that the council had restricted the ability of local governments in the 12 regions to take on debt and limited the state-funded projects they could launch. Then in November, it ordered local governments to halt “problematic” public-private partnership projects and placed other limits on investment. halt “problematic” public-private partnership projects The new directive gives a more detailed list of infrastructure projects for the governments to avoid, two sources said. One said the governments must reduce the scale of investments for projects with an investment completion rate above 50%.  Flow-on from property crisis China’s top leaders said it was necessary to coordinate and resolve the risks emanating from property, local debt and small and midsize financial firms, state media said in December, citing a Central Economic Work Conference. Beijing is concerned about potential defaults due to the local governments’ large debts and weaker growth prospects, the sources said. China’s local government debt hit 76% of gross domestic product in 2022, the latest data available, up from 62% in 2019 and dwarfing central government debt at 21%. Local governments’ debt woes were triggered by a crash in property prices and a cash crunch that left developers unable to buy more land, traditionally a key revenue source, and fewer options for raising funds as growth slowed. triggered by a crash in property prices China’s economy grew 5.2% in 2023, slightly above the official target, but the recovery was far shakier than many analysts expected, weighed down by the mounting local government debt and deepening property crisis. economy grew 5.2% in 2023 The indebted regions targeted by the State Council include Liaoning and Jilin provinces on the border with North Korea, Guizhou and Yunnan in the southwest and the cities of Tianjin and Chongqing cities. Those regions should make every effort to reduce their “debt risk to the low and medium level”, but the directive does not specify how the debt reduction will be measured, one of the sources said. Once local governments reach their debt-cutting targets, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China’s top economic planner, is to seek cabinet approval to adjust their debt policies for fresh infrastructure investments, the source said. The NDRC did not respond to a request for comment.  Reuters with additional editing by Jim Pollard          Jim Pollard is an Australian journalist based in Thailand since 1999.

      "Attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea are causing grave disruption to Chinese and other Asian exporters. shipping in the Red Sea For Chinese businessman Han Changming, the risk of attack in seas near the Suez Canal threaten the his trading company in the eastern Fujian province. Han, who exports Chinese-made cars to Africa and imports off-road vehicles from Europe, said the cost of shipping a container to Europe had more than doubled, rising to roughly $7,000 from $3,000 in December, when Yemen’s Iran-aligned Houthi movement escalated attacks on shipping. “The disruptions have wiped out our already thin profits,” said Han, adding that higher shipping-insurance premiums are also taking a toll on Fuzhou Han Changming International Trade Co Ltd, the company he founded in 2016.   The rupture of one of the world’s busiest shipping routes has exposed the vulnerability of China’s export-reliant economy to supply snarls and external demand shocks. In a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Tuesday, Premier Li Qiang emphasised the need to keep global supply chains “stable and smooth”, without referring specifically to the Red Sea. in Davos on Tuesday, Premier Li Qiang Some companies, such as US-based BDI Furniture, have said they are relying more on factories in places such as Turkey and Vietnam to mitigate the impact of the disruptions, adding to recent moves by Western countries to reduce dependence on China amid geopolitical tensions.  Risk of ‘near-shoring’ rises, New Year scramble At stake for China now is the danger that other firms will follow suit and reassess their de-risking strategy, opting potentially to shift production closer to home, an approach known as “near-shoring”. “If it’s permanent, and it could be permanent, then the whole mechanism will be readjusted,” said Marco Castelli, founder of IC Trade, which exports Chinese-made mechanical components to Europe. “Some (companies) may also consider moving more production to India, which is one week closer to Europe. Companies need to reevaluate everything.” Further Red Sea disruptions would pile pressure on a struggling Chinese economy already contending with a property crisis, weak consumer demand, a shrinking population and sluggish global growth. With Europe and Africa trade accounting for 40% of Han’s overall business, he said he had been pleading with suppliers and customers to shoulder some of the additional costs to keep his company afloat. Shipping times for some orders were delayed by up to several weeks, he said. Compounding the pain for some firms, the disruptions come as many are navigating a logistics challenge ahead of Lunar New Year in February, when some 300 million migrant workers go on leave and almost all factories in China shut, creating a scramble in the preceding weeks to get goods shipped. Mike Sagan, the Shenzhen-based vice president for supply chains and operations at KidKraft, a maker of outdoor play equipment and wooden toys, said many European customers are slamming on the brakes, saying: “Don’t ship anything, hold it”. “A lot of suppliers, they’re screaming about money today,” said Sagan, whose company supplies retailers including Walmart and Target. A worry for larger manufacturers, he said, is the snowball effect on smaller suppliers with tight margins, as they would be among the last to receive payments but are critical to the supply chain.  Big impacts as supply chains stretched Rerouting vessels from the Red Sea – the shortest route from Asia to Europe via the Suez Canal – around the Cape of Good Hope can add two weeks to shipping schedules, reducing global container capacity and cleaving supply chains as it takes longer for vessels to return to ports to reload. That probably means delays for goods scheduled to arrive on Western shelves in April or May. Some logistics companies are already reporting a container shortage at Ningbo-Zhoushan port in China, one of the world’s busiest by cargo tonnage, according to BMI, an industry research firm. The Suez Canal is a primary route for China’s westward shipments of goods, including around 60% of its exports to Europe, according to the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank. Yang Bingben, whose company makes industrial-use valves in eastern China’s manufacturing hub of Wenzhou, said a client in Shanghai this week slashed an order for 75 valves – intended for assembly into large machinery for shipment overseas – to 15 amid soaring freight costs. “The impact is huge,” said Yang, adding that he had prepared raw materials that could not be returned because they had been processed. “It’s like I received an order that makes me lose money.” Yang is now rethinking his staffing needs for this year, saying he can’t guarantee salaries as his workers are paid based on the amount of work they do. “If I don’t have enough work to give them, I’m afraid they won’t be able to make a living.” In southern China, Wei Qiongfang, a freight forwarder based in Guangzhou, said some suppliers were delaying shipments of lower-value goods, pressuring manufacturers’ stockpiles. As once-predictable trade conditions become increasingly uncertain, the impact is especially acute for companies that rely on just-in-time deliveries or that need to change their stock regularly. Another issue, said Castelli, is that factories do not get paid until goods arrive at their destination. “So if their payment is delayed, they can’t pay their suppliers, they can’t pay their workers,” he said. “China is so successful in the global market because they work with tiny margins: when you have volume, the money rolls in; when the money stops coming, you have a big problem.” In the Pearl River Delta city of Dongguan, Gerhard Flatz, managing director of premium sportswear manufacturer KTC, is concerned that some companies grappling with shrinking margins will go under. “So, they are struggling, and now there is another logistics crisis. You know, at some point many will have to shut down,” said Flatz.

      "Chinese carmaker BYD has enjoyed booming electric vehicle sales in Thailand, which is the company’s biggest foreign market. And the popularity of BYD’s EVs has encouraged Rever Automotive, the group’s sole distributor in the Kingdom, to dramatically expand its business. Rever said it will triple its dealerships in Thailand in two years in a bid to cement the Chinese automaker’s dominant sales performance.   BYD overtook Tesla as the world’s top EV maker in the fourth quarter last year, and the expansion in Thailand underscores its global push – especially in markets where its US rival has yet to become a major vendor – as EV sales growth slows in its home market China. overtook Tesla as the world’s top EV maker Rever Automotive, the distributor that helped launch BYD in Thailand in late 2022, will add 200 dealerships by end-2025, expand commercial vehicles offerings and enter new passenger car segments, CEO Pratarnwong Phornprapha said. Rever Automotive “By the end of this year, we’ll have 200. And the next year, we’re planning for another 100,” Pratarnwong said. “I think around 300 for us is a healthy number.” Rever currently has around 100 outlets, establishing BYD as the dominant carmaker in the fast-growing Thai EV market with a 40% market share, according to Pratarnwong. BYD sold a total 3 million passenger vehicles in 2023, with more than 90% of those going into the China market, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. Overseas sales amounted to around 242,000 units.  BYD to open Thai factory this year Thailand accounted for around 20% of BYD’s foreign sales in the third quarter, according to research firm Counterpoint. And as the group’s largest overseas market, BYD it is also investing 17.9 billion baht ($504 million) to build a factory scheduled to open this year. EV sales in Thailand made up a little over 7% of all passenger vehicle sales in the country in the third quarter of 2023, Counterpoint data also showed, but it is one of the fastest growing EV markets in Southeast Asia, aided by government subsidies and policies. Late last year, the Thai government approved a scaled down subsidy package for the EV industry, although still offering up to 100,000 baht ($2,764) per vehicle and lower import duties and excise taxes. Overall, Thailand plans to convert about 30% of its annual production of 2.5 million vehicles into EVs by 2030 and has attracted more than $1.44 billion in investments from Chinese auto companies.  BYD plant also planned in Indonesia BYD has been outperforming other automakers in Southeast Asia’s EV market, bolstered by partnerships with local distributors and affordable models such as the Atto 3 SUV, which was the region’s bestselling electric auto in the third quarter. On Thursday, the company unveiled three battery EV models in Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s biggest economy, where BYD is also planning to invest $1.3 billion in an assembly plant. In Thailand, its efforts to expand product offerings are set to pose a challenge to Japanese rivals, including Toyota Motor Corp, that have long dominated the country’s auto market. “Roughly, I think we have to get into MPVs, we have to get into bigger size SUVs, and smaller size sedans, bigger size sedans,” Pratarnwong said, referring to multi-purpose and sport utility vehicles and outlining the need to expand BYD’s offerings.  More models, buses planned Rever currently offers three BYD EV models in Thailand: the Seal sedan, the Atto 3 SUV and the Dolphin hatchback. Dolphin hatchback Beyond passenger cars, Rever is looking to make inroads into commercial fleets using BYD vehicles and technology, including for taxis, short-haul trucks and vans, and buses. Thailand had over 81,000 registered taxis as of September 2023, according to government data, and Rever is aiming to capture 40% of the new vehicles entering that market, said Pratarnwong. Rever is also offering the BYD T3 van for limited distance deliveries that picked up during the Covid-19 pandemic, Rever vice-CEO Pratarnporn Phornprapha said. “There’s a lot of short haul deliveries going on,” she said. “It’s a huge chunk which we wanted to focus on.” Pratarnwong and Pratarnporn are siblings hailing from the Phornprapha family that established the Siam Motors Group (SMG), which helped develop Thailand’s automotive industry. Rever is independent from SMG, Pratarnwong has previously said.

      "Officials in China and several South American nations are hoping that a deepwater port in Peru will become a gateway that ties the region to the world’s second biggest economy. China will get a direct gateway to the resource-rich region via a $3.5 billion deepwater port at Chancay, which is set to start operations late this year. In September, a group of Brazilian farmers and officials arrived in the Peruvian fishing town to inspect the a new Chinese mega port rising on the Pacific coast, promising to turbo charge South America’s trade ties with China.   Over the last ten years, Beijing has unseated the United States as the largest trade partner for South America, devouring its soy, corn and copper. The port, majority-owned by Chinese state-owned firm Cosco Shipping, will be the first controlled by China in South America. It will able to accommodate the largest cargo ships, which can head directly to Asia, cutting the journey time by two weeks for some exporters.  Possible hub for copper, soy exports Beijing and Lima hope Chancay will become a regional hub, both for copper exports from the Andean nation as well as soy from western Brazil, which currently travels through the Panama Canal or skirts the Atlantic before steaming to China. “The Chancay mega port aims to turn Peru into a strategic commercial and port hub between South America and Asia,” Peru’s trade minister Juan Mathews Salazar said. Part of China’s decade-old ‘Belt and Road’ drive, the new port embodies the challenge facing the United States and Europe as they look to counter Beijing’s rising influence in Latin America. China’s trade muscle has helped it win allies and gain leverage in political forums, finance and technology. Belt and Road’ drive Full construction started in 2018 at Chancay, some 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of Lima. Workers are now laying thousands of piles and breakwaters; work signs are written in white-on-red Chinese characters. The first phase of Chancay is set be completed in November 2024. Chinese President Xi Jinping, expected in Peru for an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit that month, could inaugurate the port, a diplomatic source in Lima said. China’s embassy in Lima did not respond to Reuters’ queries. “It’s part of China’s new Silk Road,” said Mario de las Casas, corporate affairs manager for Cosco Shipping, which holds a 60% stake in the port. The remainder is controlled by local miner Volcan, in which Glencore owns a stake. Jose Adriano da Silva, a farming entrepreneur from Brazil’s western Acre state who visited the port, said the project would accelerate regional development. He said talks between Peruvian and Brazilian officials were underway to resolve overland transport challenges.  Economic zone planned near port Peru’s government is planning an exclusive economic zone near the port and Cosco wants to build an industrial hub near Chancay to process raw materials that could include grains and meat from Brazil before shipping them to Asia. Brazil’s ambassador in Peru, Clemente Baena Soares, said there were plans for meetings between officials early this year to seek to resolve logistical, sanitary and bureaucratic hurdles at the border so Brazilian trucks can more easily reach the port. “It’s an opportunity for grain and meat production – especially from Rondonia, Acre, Mato Grosso and Amazonas – to go to Asia through the port of Chancay,” said Soares, who also visited Chancay in September, naming four states in western Brazil. “(Brazilian businesses) are delighted with the possibility of not using the Panama Canal to take their goods to Asia.” He added there would need to be investment in an existing road known as the Interoceanic Highway – which runs from further south in Peru across the Andes to Brazil – to improve transport routes. A long-discussed rail link remained in the study phase, he said.  China now a key regional partner China overtook the United States on trade in South and Central America under former President Donald Trump, despite his administration warning the region about the dangers of getting too close to Beijing. Under President Joe Biden the gap has widened despite attempts to reverse it. US officials are now taking a different tack, arguing that the United States offers the region other things beyond trade, including investment in high-tech industries. “I think using the metric of trade to evaluate the influence of China is not an accurate way,” Juan Gonzalez, a White House adviser and the National Security Council’s Western Hemisphere senior director, told Reuters in Buenos Aires. “We’re confident in our ability to compete with China,” he added, urging regional governments to ensure there were no “political strings attached” to trade with Beijing. Beijing says its trade and investment in Latin America is a win-win for both sides. Some 150 countries have signed on to the Belt and Road with China, including 22 in Latin America. The change over 10 years is stark. A decade ago, Peru, the world’s no-2 copper producer, traded slightly more with the United States than China. Now, China has a more than $10 billion lead in bilateral trade, the latest annual data show. That trend is playing out around the region. Reuters interviewed two dozen officials, business leaders and trade experts, along with an analysis of 10 years of trade data, revealing how China’s infrastructure spending is cementing its role as the key trade and investment partner for South America, defying an economic slowdown at home and US warnings about “debt-trap” diplomacy. Part of the shift is pragmatic. Fast-growing China needs the copper and lithium from South America’s Andes, along with the corn and soy from the plains of Argentina and Brazil. But its widening trade lead – some $100 billion around South America in the most recent annual data – brings extra clout. Beijing has in the last year upgraded ties with Uruguay and Colombia to “strategic partnerships” – the latter a US ally. Argentina’s President Javier Milei, once highly critical of China, has softened his stance since taking office last month, reflecting Beijing’s importance to the crisis-hit economy. It is the top buyer of Argentina’s soy and beef and has an $18-billion currency swap line with the country – which Argentina’s cash-strapped government has tapped to pay its debt, including with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). “The last thing our dear Argentine friends need in these challenging times is to lose the support of an important partner like China,” the Chinese ambassador in Colombia wrote on social media platform X following Milei’s inauguration.  China-Peru trade doubled over last decade Peru’s trade with China doubled in the last decade to $33 billion in 2022, driven by rising copper exports, even as its commerce flatlined with the United States. China has invested some $24 billion in Peruvian mines, the power grid, transportation and hydro-electric power generation over the same period. Exports to China grew 9.3% in the first eleven months of last year, government data show, faster than the 5.3% growth of exports to the US. Peru has a $9.4 billion trade surplus with China and a $1.3 billion deficit with the United States. Peru’s President Dina Boluarte met China’s Xi in November at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in San Francisco. They discussed the Chancay port, which Boluarte said was a “significant boost to free trade and new Chinese investments.” That came after an awkward on-the-move parlay in Washington with Biden, which was not given full bilateral meeting status. “China is taking advantage of our absence and that’s a real problem,” said Eric Farnsworth, a former White House adviser and State Department official, who is now a Latin America expert at the Council of the Americas and Americas Society. He said the port bolstered China’s powerful position in Peru and created a “point of leverage” in the region. Two regional diplomats said it also reflected a more muscular and ambitious China, often backed by deep pockets: a far cry from a wave of Chinese immigration to Peru two centuries ago when migrants came as cotton workers or to set up ‘chifas’ – Chinese food outlets. “Now business executives or bankers come, with big projects tucked under their belts,” said Juan Carlos Capuñay, Peru’s former ambassador to China.  ‘Desperate for financing’ China hasn’t had things all its own way. Its Belt and Road has faced pushback in Asia and Europe – Italy recently pulled out of the initiative – while bad debts owed to China have ballooned. In Latin America, projects from Argentina to Venezuela have faced hold-ups. projects from Argentina to Venezuela have faced hold-ups Diplomats and trade experts also cautioned that the Chancay port would only be successful if regional infrastructure including roads and railways improved to enable goods to get there, including grains from Brazil. Currently, the Interocean Highway – a little-used road corridor of some 2,600 kilometers (1,616 miles) in five sections, built more than a decade ago – links the Pacific Coast in the south of Peru to Brazil’s state of Acre. “The issue today is a lack of regional connections, which is very complex for the success of the project,” Fernando Reyes Matta, former Chilean ambassador to China, said. Nonetheless, several of the people said China’s rise in South America was solidifying despite these headwinds, with the region desperate for financing and foreign currency. A senior European diplomat based in South America said the big gap in infrastructure funding in the region made it hard forthe United States to “strong arm” local governments to turn down Chinese money. Meanwhile, global interest had grown in South America’s resources such as lithium, copper and grains. “Latin America has become a new battleground for those minerals between the United States, Europe and China,” he said.

      "India is still far from reaching a final decision on slashing import taxes on electric vehicles — a move it had been mulling to facilitate Tesla’s entry into the country — amid resistance from local carmakers. The world’s third-largest car market currently imposes a whopping 100% import tax on EVs. But last year, Indian officials began considering lowering that to 15% for automakers that commit to eventually investing and manufacturing in the country. began considering lowering that to 15% Officials, however, have still not been able to “take a final call on this so far,“ said Rajesh Kumar Singh, a top bureaucrat at India’s department for industry and trade promotion.   Singh told Reuters at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos that the delay came on the back of increasing “resistance from domestic industry” which might find itself in direct competition with Elon Musk-owned Tesla if the import tax is lowered. One of the primary motivators for India to reduce the EV import tax had been Tesla’s interest in building a factory in India. The US EV giant had said last year that it was interested in producing in India an EVpriced at $24,000 — which would be around 25% cheaper than Tesla’s current entry model. The EV-maker had also called for lower taxes on more expensive models it wants to sell in India. Tesla would likely try to bring cars to the market in India in the range of $24,000 to $36,000 because they know “that’s where the volumes” will be available, Singh said late on Wednesday. “The issue is raising resistance from domestic industry because they are also in that (EV price) segment,” he added. “It’s a very contested area.”  ‘Level playing field’ While Singh did not name any domestic automakers, India’s Tata Motors and Mahindra &amp; Mahindrahave previously pressed officials tonot lower EV import taxes. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Managing Director Anish Shah called this week in an interview for a level playing field between domestic and foreign EV automakers, saying India must promote local manufacturing. Separately, Tata — India’s biggest EV player — is also lobbying the Indian government to not cut taxes on hybrid cars such as those from Japan’s Toyota as they are more polluting than pure electrics. to not cut taxes on hybrid cars Further incentivisation of hybrids, which are already taxed lower than gasoline cars, “will be a detriment to climate goals and nation’s economy,” Tata wrote in a letter to India’s trade department. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra and South Korea’s Hyundai Motor, have also asked New Delhi to not reduce taxes on hybrids.  ‘Make in India’ Tesla first tried to enter India by demanding lower import taxes, which Elon Musk said were “highest in the world by far of any large country”. by demanding lower import taxes That demand on taxes led to deadlocked talks with New Delhi in 2022. Recently, in a shift in stance, Tesla has offered to set up local manufacturing which India has pushed for. deadlocked talks with New Delhi in 2022 “There have been some discussions on whether you lower the tariff for a short period of time but he [Musk] also accepts fairly significant investment and domestic value addition criteria,” the Indian official, Singh, told Reuters. This would allow Tesla to bring in a limited number of vehicles for a short period of time, although Musk would also need to provide “cast iron commitments to invest in India, make in India,” Singh said. India sold 4 million cars last year, of which just 82,000 were EVs, but the nascent segment clocked sales growth of 115% versus the previous year. The country is promoting EVs as part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s drive to reduce pollution, taxing them at just 5%. In comparison, the levy is 43% on hybrids and the highest, 48%, on petrol cars. The government is also trying to deploy proper charging infrastructure across the nation as a lack of that is a key reason that consumers are hesitant to switch to EVs, Singh said.

      "In its latest move to step up oversight of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) technology, China has issued draft guidelines for standardising the industry. The draft guidelines aim at “seizing the early opportunities from the development of the AI industry”, China’s industry ministry said in a statement posted its website on Wednesday. The draft proposes to form more than 50 national and industry-wide standards for AI by 2026.   It also said China aimed to participate in forming more than 20 international standards for AI by that time. The ministry added that 60% of these prospective standards should be aimed towards serving “general key technologies and application development projects”. Furthermore, it aims to have more than 1,000 companies adopt and advocate for these new standards. The development comes at a time when China is trying to catch up with the United States in AI development after US company OpenAI shocked the world with its generative AI sensation ChatGPT in 2022. China sees AI as an area in which it wants to rival the US, and has set its sights on becoming a world leader in the field by 2030.  China’s push to regulate AI The Xi Jinping-led government has also taken a lead in developing regulations to oversee AI at a time when countries globally are grappling with setting guardrails for the technology. Last year in April, China’s cyberspace regulator unveiled draft measures for managing ChatGPT-like generative AI services, saying it wants firms to submit security assessments to authorities before they launch their offerings to the public. draft measures for managing ChatGPT-like generative AI services The regulator added that China supports AI innovation and application, but content generated by generative AI had to be in line with the country’s core socialist values. At a time when the industry globally was debating ethical issues around material used to train AI models, the Chinese regulator also said that generative AI providers will be responsible for the legitimacy of data used to train generative AI products. It further directed providers to take measures to prevent discrimination when designing algorithms and training data for their services. In October, the regulator also proposed a blacklist of sources that cannot be used to train AI models. a blacklist of sources The sources included those “advocating terrorism” or violence, as well as “overthrowing the socialist system”, “damaging the country’s image”, and “undermining national unity and social stability”. Most recently, in December — a time when copyright concerns around AI-generated material were at their peak — a court in China awarded damages to a creator who sued a blogger for using his AI-generated image without permission. The court said the creator had “made a certain degree of intellectual investment” in selecting prompts to generate the image and was, thus, protected by copyright law. “made a certain degree of intellectual investment”  Reuters, with additional inputs from Vishakha Saxena  China’s Baidu Claims Its Ernie AI Bot is Better Than ChatGPT Western Spy Chiefs Warn China Using AI to Steal Tech Secrets      Vishakha Saxena is the Multimedia and Social Media Editor at Asia Financial.

      "China and Southeast Asia have seen an explosion in transnational organized crime that has been “super-charged” by illegal online casinos, underground banking systems, cryptocurrency and the civil war in Myanmar, according to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime. An analysis published by the UNODC this week said over 340 licensed and unlicensed land-based casinos were operating in Southeast Asia as early as 2022, most of which have now shifted online, and utilize the vast underground banking and money laundering infrastructure in the ASEAN region and East Asia. analysis published by the UNODC UNODC regional chief Jeremy Douglas, who spoke at a press conference in Bangkok on Wednesday night, said casinos in Southeast Asia were clustered in special economic zones (SEZs) along the China-Myanmar border, plus areas near the borders of Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. special economic zones Douglas said the Covid-19 crisis led to an dramatic expansion in online gambling and the technology used by online casinos had been adopted by criminal groups who set up cyber-scam operations in SEZs near the China-Myanmar border and other countries in the region in recent years. other countries   Chinese triads and criminal gangs were using infrastructure set up by online casinos as an underground banking system “and that infrastructure has super-charged the overall illicit economy of this region, including the drugs economy,” Douglas said. “It’s effectively allowed for money movement in a much bigger and much more creative ways and more untraceable ways than in the past,” he said in a talk at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Bangkok (see video link). talk at the Foreign Correspondents Club in Bangkok (see video link “It’s incredibly difficult for governments to deal with this, as they have to deal with all the transactions and to understand that, because the innovation in that space is huge.” An official from Thailand’s Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) said problems had proliferated because drug tycoons were operating more freely in the Golden Triangle amid Myanmar’s civil war, and cyber crimes had grown to be the issue of most concern. Transnational organized crime gangs were using cryptocurrencies and fast-evolving technologies which made it easier to set up bank accounts abroad to launder proceeds of crime, AMLO official Supranee Satitchaicharoen said, making cyber payments to banks or legitimate businesses to conceal their gains.  China hits back at ‘fraud epidemic’ China, which has been the focus of many cyber-scam groups and online casinos, has cracked down on online gambling plus fraud gangs both in and outside its borders, because of the huge scale of losses suffered by its citizens and the fact these criminal syndicates are usually operated by Chinese nationals. The Ministry of Public Security said over 13 million citizens had sought help to stop them becoming victims of fraud, according to a recent report by the China Daily, which said authorities intercepted 2.75 billion fraudulent calls and 2.28 billion fraudulent messages. China Daily The ministry had dealt with 8.36 million fraudulent Internet domain names, and intercepted 328.8 billion yuan ($46 billion) of funds related to fraud cases, it said. “Task forces were dispatched to countries including Thailand, the Philippines, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam and Indonesia for international law enforcement cooperation, resulting in the dismantling of numerous overseas fraud dens and the arrest of over 3,000 criminal suspects, creating a strong deterrent effect.” A key focus were fraud groups operating in Kokang special region in Shan state in northern Myanmar, which were ousted by an alliance of three ethnic resistance groups who confronted the junta-backed militia protecting the criminal gangs last last year. Kokang special region in Shan state in northern Myanmar The UNODC’s Douglas said the cyber-scams “became an all-of-government issue in China .. as whole families had lost everything” to the scammers.  Boom in financial crime Some senior financial officials in the US are also starting to warn that the scale of financial crime has risen dramatically. Nasdaq researchers said more than $3 trillion in illicit funds flowed through the global financial system in 2023. That included $782.9 billion in drug trafficking activity, $346.7 billion in human trafficking, and $11.5 billion in terrorist financing, it said. Nasdaq One year ago, a key target of Beijing was the Sun City group in Macau founded by casino operator Alvin Chau Cheok Wa, who was convicted in a high-profile crackdown on cross-border gambling. casino operator Alvin Chau The scale of money going through Chau’s casinos was far greater than his organisation admitted, with Douglas saying officials discovered over $100 billion went through Chau’s casinos over six to eight years. “These were very big illicit money flows – it’s a political problem for this region and the world. The [Southeast Asian] region needs to respond to this at the highest political level. It’s not just a police issue.” Chau, Sun City’s billionaire casino founder, ended up receiving an 18-year term, but regional police sources said he had been allowed to serve his sentence in Macau because he had “rolled over” and helped reveal details of his network on the mainland and other information on his computers. While organized crime gangs holding thousands of people trafficked to work in cyber-scams centres had been forced out of cities such as Laukkai, Douglas said the UNODC and police within the region were watching to see if the organized crime gangs from Kokang shift to the notorious enclaves on the Thai-Myanmar border near the town of Myawaddy – or to other countries with weak governance in East Africa or elsewhere. notorious enclaves on the Thai-Myanmar border Meanwhile, there are now concerns that Thailand could be opening the door to a wave of organized crime if it gives a green light to casinos within the country. A senior regional police source said the new Pheu Thai government had been warned to adopt strong security and anti-money laundering protocols, similar to those imposed in Singapore, to avoid the sort of problems likely to draw scrutiny from international watchdogs such as the Financial Action Task Force.

Davletov’s main focus is the Eat&Fit company, a healthy food organization and delivery service.  Eat&Fit specialists develop meal plans with a particular focus on fitness and nutrition goals, such as weight loss or muscle gain.  “It is a little difficult to get used to this nutrition format due to muted tastes. As soon as the receptors are ‘cleaned’ and become more sensitive to the real taste of products instead of flavor enhancers, it starts to feel comfortable. Our clients forget about the severity, overeating, and heartburn. There is no need to think about what to eat for lunch today, spend time cooking, waiting for couriers or standing in lunch queues in cafes,” said Davletov.      Eat&Fit is still in the formative stage. There are 10 people in the office team and nearly 60 people in production facilities and delivery systems.  “It seems to me that we still do not have a clear organizational structure. We understand the need to test new products and approaches in such a fast-paced market. The structure is also constantly changing. Many things can be outsourced in modern business,” he said.   The opening of Eat&Fit was initiated by three people, both partners and friends.   “We founded the company in 2015 after the food tech sector started to develop in Russia. We were pioneers in this field in Kazakhstan. Unfortunately, we could not maintain partnership and friendship, and now I am the only owner,” noted Davletov.  The entrepreneur recalled the rapid growth he observed in the launch stage. Later, similarly to other startup stories, Eat&Fit encountered the death valley curve, the challenging period between the company’s initial funding and its first revenue.          “Just as we started to get out of this difficult phase, quarantine restrictions appeared due to COVID-19. The relevance of the subscription model during the pandemic was very low. At that time, all restaurants and cafes entered the food delivery market. Besides, our client stayed at home with plenty of free time,” said Davletov.     The largest customer category consists of high-level specialists and top managers, the company’s customer development methodology shows. Most often, they focus on careers and developing their professional skills, according to the Eat&Fit founder. “Our audience values their time, yet it takes a lot of effort to form a varied diet on their own. It does expand, but not as fast as we would want. As an entrepreneur, I have ambitions to build a big business, but unfortunately, we have a very narrow market in this segment,” said Davletov.   He noted the lack of high demand for the Eat&Fit product.  “Let’s be honest, healthy food with subscription delivery is not the basic need of every person. People live on credit without their own housing and sophistications, no matter how sad it sounds. Therefore, if we talk about what goals our product covers, then this is rather one of the ways to make life more comfortable when the basic needs are already covered,” he said.  Comparing Russian and Kazakh food delivery markets, Davletov highlighted that Kazakhstan will ensure a similar infrastructure for developing this area in the short run.     “In Russia, most players in the grocery store market with their own brands sell healthy food in boxes. The delivery infrastructure makes it easy to order and receive lunch within 15 minutes,” he noted.        As a case in point, Davletov brought an example of Mealty, the Russian ready-to-eat meal delivery service.    “Mealty is represented in many business centers in Russia. Healthy food is available almost everywhere. I think Kazakhstan will soon have a similar story. For instance, Kaspi Bank and e-Magnum [the Magnum E-commerce Kazakhstan project] have already concluded respective agreements,” said Davletov.  Accelerated digitalization in Kazakhstan covers the food retail industry as well. Apart from other features, Kaspi Bank’s e-grocery system has risen in demand among the population. Last February, the bank gained operational control over e-Magnum. It decided to invest 70 billion tenge (US$15 million) in the development of the e-Magnum joint venture in the next three years and received 90% ownership of the company.     “There is also a raft of new startups, including Chocofood, Airba Fresh, Arbuz.kz, and Clever. So far, they all specialize in products. To increase the repeatability of orders, one way or another they will introduce ready-made food, including healthy meals,” he noted.            Given Davletov’s willingness to promote wellness among citizens in his own way and make this objective the company’s mission, the entrepreneur said he doubts people need it. “My good friend and successful entrepreneur Ilyas Isatayev said that we are engaged in a countercultural business. It is now a trend to have breakfasts in coffee shops or dinners in hookah bars. We constantly face the objection that 8,000-9,000 tenge [US$18-19] for five meals a day is expensive, while these same people leave twice as much money for hookahs and alcohol,” said Davletov.    “The situation is still a bit unclear. On the one hand, people care more about their health. On the other hand, we are experiencing financial difficulties: over the past couple of years, food and packaging materials have become very expensive. Overall, life has become much more expensive, affecting the increase in the entire wage fund, but the purchasing power is still decreasing,” he added.    Another project Davletov runs is a photo studio called Krai Sveta (The World’s Edge), where his spouse Gulnara Davletova organizes photo sessions. When asked about family and work, he said it is difficult to combine partnership and family relations in business.   “First, I expected my wife to be in charge of the studio. Later, I realized that it was more important for me to make her feel comfortable than for the studio to earn more. So she’s just doing what she loves and what she’s good at – photography,” he said.  Davletov shared three factors that differentiate his studio from others in the city.      “Due to the facility’s remoteness and low rent per square meter, we could open three halls at once instead of one. Secondly, we chose a model with interior halls for a specific theme, rather than locations with decorations. We made the interior minimalistic so that it would not lose relevance for as long as possible. Thirdly, we have also focused on videography, because in this area the price is higher, and the trend is growing,” he said. The entrepreneur continues to study the experience of foreign companies, saying that he understands “the need to refine or change the business model, as the company now faces limitations when scaling.”  In 2024, Eat&Fit plans to introduce a precedent for a radical change with a preliminary action plan. Davletov addresses various scenarios given the significant influence of external factors on the course of events.   \n",

      "In the rapidly changing world, companies are confronted with the necessity to optimize their processes. Through a clear delineation of operational activities, companies identify the least effective directions in terms of resource management. In such cases, BPO providers can offer the most advantageous conditions and take on these challenging tasks. Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) is a strategy whereby companies delegate the execution of certain business processes to third parties. The primary goal of BPO is to enhance the efficiency of a company’s operations and reduce costs. This practice enables companies to focus on their core tasks. BPO outsourcing may encompass delegating tasks such as data processing, customer service, financial operations, human resource management, and more. Let’s delve into these areas more comprehensively. 1. IT outsourcing: In the field of information technology, BPO involves technical support, testing, data collection, and processing, allowing companies to concentrate on innovation rather than operational issues. 2. Customer service: Outsourcing contact centers play a crucial role in improving customer relations, order processing, and support, freeing up client resources to concentrate on strategic customer interactions. 3. Financial services: In the financial domain, BPO organizations can provide qualified services in accounting, financial analysis, and invoice processing. 4. Human resource management: BPO providers assist companies with hiring, training, and personnel management. 5. Logistics and supply chain: In this sphere, companies can maintain continuous operations by engaging contractors from different regions. How the BPO market developed The global Business Process Outsourcing market emerged in the 1980s and 1990s. The primary reason behind the development of the BPO sector mirrors the trend of relocating manufacturing facilities from Western countries to the Asian region during that period — aiming to reduce costs through lower operational expenses and more accessible labor resources. However, BPO offers additional advantages: 1. Concentration on core activities by delegating non-core tasks to external organizations. 2. Competitiveness and global market presence with access to unique resources. 3. The experience and expertise of BPO providers enable companies to achieve superior results in specific domains. 4. Flexibility and scalability based on the resources and needs of the company. The initial forms of outsourcing involved transferring functions such as data processing and telemarketing to third parties. With the evolution of information technology, BPO transformed to meet the needs of IT giants. In the early 2000s, India emerged as a global hub for BPO services. Through state incentives, the country was able to offer skilled professionals with excellent language skills at competitive labor costs. Companies from North America and Europe began outsourcing customer service and IT processes to India. Since then, outsourcing has diversified into new areas. Companies started outsourcing financial and human resource management tasks to contractors. In the IT sector, clients expressed a need for data processing and analysis, as well as development of artificial intelligence technologies, and automation. Over time, the geography of BPO centers also expanded. Countries like the Philippines, Malaysia, Poland, Romania, Ukraine, and BPO providers from South America started competing for market share. Uzbekistan was not an exception and joined the race in 2020. BPO Support in Uzbekistan A distinctive feature of BPO in Uzbekistan lies in the direct support provided by the government for this sector. Assistance is facilitated through the IT Park complex, established in 2019. Collaborating with the Park is not limited to technological corporations, enterprises seeking to delegate non-core business processes to specialized professionals also engage in partnership. 220 IT Park resident companies provide BPO services in the following segments: - Dispatch services - 121 — 55% - Call centers - 50 — 22.7% - Accounting - 27 — 12.3% - Other services - 22 — 10% These companies contribute 20% of the total volume of IT service exports, which amounted to $305 million in the first 11 months of 2023. IT Park actively supports the development of BPO companies in the following areas: - Dispatch services; - Customer support services and call centers; - Recruiting and HR agencies; - Data processing and entry; - IT process outsourcing; - Procurement management; - Digital marketing. Advantages of Collaborating with BPO Providers from Uzbekistan Despite being a newcomer to the relatively mature BPO market, Uzbekistan has much to offer to foreign companies. Beyond the availability of knowledgeable professionals at a competitive labor cost, the government actively incentivizes the industry through preferential measures. As mentioned earlier, IT Park undertakes this task by uniting not only technological companies and startups but also creates equally favorable conditions for BPO service providers. These conditions include low tax rates and preferential opportunities for utilizing the Park’s infrastructure. The following is a detailed comparison of Uzbekistan’s capabilities, particularly those of IT Park, in relation to the global BPO market. Low Taxes In Poland and the Philippines, a zero or low VAT rate exists. However, such preferential taxation is not extended to BPO companies. The same situation applies to the progressive income tax scale. In the Philippines, low-income professionals may qualify for a zero rate. According to average salary, BPO employees are subject to an income tax rate of 15-20%. In India, this figure stands at 5-10%. Following tax reforms, Uzbekistan has fostered a favorable business climate conducive to entrepreneurial development. Currently, VAT, corporate, and income taxes are lower than in other BPO centers. By obtaining residency in IT Park, companies can reduce income tax and completely eliminate corporate tax and VAT. However, it is crucial to note that residents, after the preferential 6-month period, are obligated to transfer one percent of their total income to the deposit account. These funds are allocated to the maintenance and development of IT Park infrastructure. Sources: Optimal combination of labor cost and skills Employee salary and qualifications are pivotal factors when selecting a BPO provider. Uzbekistan can boast a relatively low labor cost, coupled with workers proficient in foreign languages and possessing high literacy and requisite competencies. Approximately 60 IT universities in the country annually produce over 29,000 skilled professionals. Notably, at the branches of leading foreign educational institutions such as INHA and Amity, training is conducted in English. Over 5 million young Uzbeks are fluent in English. The youth under 30 years old constitute two-thirds of the country’s population. Consequently, this talent pool is open to acquiring new knowledge and adaptable to changing conditions in the labor market. Certain positions in Uzbekistan are more highly remunerated than in some regions. However, as previously noted, specialists from Uzbekistan possess advanced skills, and the preferential tax system enables a more competitive salary. Sources: Benefits Offered by IT Park to Residents In addition to favorable tax incentives, IT Park creates unique conditions for residents to launch new businesses and develop existing ones. The following programs make business in IT Park advantageous: Zero Risk — program aimed to reduce costs and risks for foreign companies entering the Uzbekistan market. Benefits include: - Free office equipped with furniture and equipment in regions for 12 months. - Reimbursement of up to 15% of employee salaries. - Reimbursement of up to 50% of expenses for training and professional development courses. One Stop Shop — program for the swift and easy turnkey opening of a company, including: - Registration of a legal entity. - Preparation of initial documentation. - Obtaining the personal identification number (PINFL) by power of attorney. - Opening a bank account. Local2Global — program supporting local companies in Uzbekistan when expanding into international markets to stimulate their export activities. Residents can receive 50% coverage of expenses for: - Foreign visits of clients to Uzbekistan. - Export consulting services. - Export mentoring. - Foreign trips and participation in international exhibitions and seminars. - Free access to top courses on Coursera. IT Visa — foreign investors and IT professionals, as well as founders of IT Park residents, can obtain a multiple-entry visa for up to 3 years, extendable without leaving Uzbekistan. IT visa provides specialists with: - Medical services and education equally with Uzbekistan citizens. - Temporary registration for the visa duration. - The opportunity to purchase real estate of any value. Procedure for Obtaining Residency in IT Park IT Park comprehensively fosters the BPO market in the country. Foreign clients can easily discover the most suitable outsourcing service providers with qualified professionals, while BPO companies can benefit from unique incentives, reducing operational costs and risks. To obtain residency, it is necessary to establish a legal entity within the territory of Uzbekistan and submit an online application with a business plan on the my.it-park.uz portal.

      "ASTANA — A soon-to-be-finalized free trade agreement between the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and Iran will elevate annual mutual trade to $18-20 billion and open doors for Kazakhstan, EAEU member, to fortify its presence in the Iranian market, said Andrey Slepnev, the member of the Board for Trade of the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC), during a Dec. 21 briefing, Kazinform reported.  Speaking about Kazakhstan’s potential gains, Slepnev highlighted the prospects for supplying traditional Kazakh products to Iran.  “In Kazakhstan, we see prospects for the supply of traditional Kazakh products to Iran, first of all, wheat, barley, agri-food products, and in the industry — metals, chemical products. This agreement will allow Kazakhstan to increase its presence in the Iranian market,” he added. Slepnev underscored the strategic importance of Iran as a sizable market, a neighboring nation, and a pivotal player in the international North-South transport corridor.  “Iran is a large market, our neighbor, and a key country in the international North-South transport corridor. We consider the new agreement as one of the elements of this corridor,” said Slepnev. He also emphasized that expanding the EAEU’s trade partnerships with third countries will allow for harnessing and growing the transit and transport potential of EAEU countries. With trade involving Iran, there will be a natural use of the North-South corridor, simultaneously contributing to the East-West corridor that traverses Central Asian countries and Russia. Slepnev highlighted the increasing demand for inland transport corridors amid international turbulence. He emphasized the competitive advantage of speed and convenience in today’s economic landscape, asserting that the EAEU’s proactive approach positions it favorably to capitalize on emerging opportunities. Trade between EAEU countries and Iran operates under a temporary agreement established in 2019, covering over 360 product items. Despite its temporary nature, this arrangement facilitated a remarkable doubling of mutual trade in just three years, surging from $2.5 billion to over $5 billion. By 2022, the figure had climbed to an impressive $6.2 billion. Slepnev outlined the ambitious goals set by the agreement, asserting that the transition to a comprehensive agreement would pave the way for a rapid doubling of trade. The initial target is set at $18-20 billion, a milestone deemed achievable in the foreseeable future. The EAEU-Iran free trade agreement is scheduled for adoption next week. The agreement’s implementation will adhere to the World Trade Organization (WTO) principles. Work is underway to harmonize regulations, particularly given that Iran is not a WTO member. Additionally, efforts will be directed towards expanding payment channels in national currencies.\n",

Shakkaliyev highlighted Kazakhstan’s opportunities for exporting processed products with high added value. These are products of the petrochemical, metallurgical, food, chemical, engineering, pharmaceutical, and automotive industries. The minister emphasized that the Pakistani ports Gwadar, Karachi, Qasim are of great interest to Kazakhstan both from the position of promoting exports to the markets of Pakistan and South Asia, and from the position of enhancing transit potential for accessing markets to the Persian Gulf markets and East Africa. Shakkaliyev noted the possibility of mutual supplies via land routes through the territories of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan, and sea ports through the North-South corridor, the territory of Iran or through China. Another potential route is the Karakoram Highway through the territories of the Kyrgyz Republic, China and further to Pakistan. In turn, Niaz underscored Pakistan’s readiness to export seafood, construction materials, sports equipment, textiles, and agricultural products to Kazakhstan. He invited Kazakh businesses to evaluate the investment opportunities of Pakistan, emphasizing the country’s interest in foreign investment. The ministers also discussed progress on a draft roadmap for trade and economic cooperation between Kazakhstan and Pakistan, with plans to sign it in the coming year. Trade turnover between the countries totaled $38.7 million in January-October. Kazakhstan’s exports to Pakistan primarily included dried legumes, oats, onions, garlic, flax seeds, buckwheat, millet and other grains.

      "The Kazakhstan Association of Blockchain Technologies and Data Centres has revised specific regulations of Kazakhstan’s tax legislation, which previously hindered the development of digital mining and digital asset exchanges. The association collaborated with the key government bodies and the Parliament to review some taxes and payments over six months. As a result, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev signed the law on amendments and additions to tax legislation on Dec. 12.  If previously the rate of payment for digital mining for consumption of 1 kilowatt/hour of electricity was paid differentiated (depending on the cost of electricity) in the amount of 26 tenge, then from Jan. 1, 2024, the number of payments for consumption of 1 kilowatt/hour of electricity by digital mining will be fixed at 2 tenge. The payment rate for digital mining for consumption of 1 kilowatt/hour of electricity when using its generating facilities, the amount previously 10 tenge, will subsequently be revised to 1 tenge. Digital asset exchanges registered in Kazakhstan are henceforth exempt from paying the value-added tax (VAT) on digital asset transactions. The previous obligation to pay VAT put Kazakhstan’s digital asset exchanges in a non-competitive position in the global market of digital asset turnover. The cancellation of VAT is timely and justified. The article 264 of the Tax Code was also excluded due to the duplication of existing regulations.  Our association will continue to work on creating a transparent digital asset industry in Kazakhstan. For this purpose, we monitor the existing legal regulations to identify and revise those that hinder the regular development of the digital asset industry.

      "ASTANA — Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov officially commenced the construction of the Bakhty-Ayagoz railway line, spanning 272 kilometers in the Abai Region via a teleconference on Dec. 21, anticipating a 20 million ton boost in freight turnover between Kazakhstan and China, reported the Prime Minister’s press service.  The initiation of this project aligns with President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev’s directive to bolster Kazakhstan’s transport and transit potential. As part of the development, a third border crossing with China, Bakhty-Chuguchak, is set to open, fostering increased trade and connectivity between the two countries. The Bakhty-Ayagoz railway line is anticipated to substantially augment the throughput capacity between Kazakhstan and China, elevating it from 28 million tons to approximately 48 million tons. The initiative aims to alleviate congestion at southern checkpoints, attracting additional transit volumes and fostering economic growth. The double-track railway is scheduled to be operational by 2027. Highlighting the collaborative nature of the endeavor, the large-scale project will involve a private investor under public-private partnership (PPP) principles. The construction will establish 11 stations, 47 bridges, 23 railways, eight road overpasses, five pedestrian bridges, and 16 observation structures. To support the project, over 500,000 units of sleepers and 36 tons of rails are planned to be procured from domestic manufacturers, with an emphasis on achieving at least 85% local content. Prime Minister Alikhan Smailov emphasized the significance of this project amid rising cargo transport. Despite geopolitical challenges and infrastructure constraints, Kazakhstan witnessed a historic high in cargo transport volume last year, reaching 245 billion tons per kilometer. “In the last five years, transit container traffic has surged by a factor of 3.2. Existing transit corridors are expanding, and new routes are emerging,” said Smailov, emphasizing the growing significance of the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route, North-South, and Southern Corridors. Recognizing the current peak in throughput and infrastructure capacities, the Prime Minister highlighted the strategic decision to implement  various railway infrastructure project s. These include the construction of  second tracks  on the Dostyk-Moyynty section, a new railway bypassing Almaty, and the Darbaza – Maktaaral railway line, collectively contributing over 1,300 km of new railways within three years. Alikhan Smailov underscored the positive economic impact of the Bakhty-Ayagoz project on the Abai region and the entire country. Job creation through construction activities and the subsequent establishment of unloading and loading points is expected to provide opportunities for over 1,700 individuals. Deputy Chairman of Kazakhstan Temir Zholy  national company  Kanat Almagambetov highlighted the economic benefits of the new railway line, anticipating an increase in Kazakh exports and transit of goods between Russia and China. He emphasized that the double-track line’s capacity would immediately meet the demands of transit cargo, stimulating the development of adjacent territories.\n",

      "An event in London brings the potential of Uzbekistan’s IT sector to the attention of the UK’s buyers and investors. Ever since I returned from the Uzbek ICT Week in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, in October, I have been taking a closer look at the country’s IT sector. I have previously outlined how and why I thought Uzbekistan could become a regional tech hub; Connecting it with the UK and exploring opportunities for UK companies was a natural next step, so I was delighted to have hosted a seminar in London earlier this week designed to do just that. Although Uzbekistan is currently focused on the development of its IT sector, its software development experience is nothing new. According to Abdukarim Kadirov, Investment Director at Realsoft, an Uzbek company operating in the country for two decades and now present in several other geographies, software development in Uzbekistan dates back to the 1980s, although it was the independence of Uzbekistan three decades ago that gave the sector a significant boost. “Right after independence, the government was the biggest buyer of software solutions, so we started by digitising the inefficiencies in government processes,” he said during the session in London. Biyi Oloko, CEO at Stephen Simeon Limited headquartered in the UK, who recently brought three companies from his portfolio to Uzbekistan, talked about some of the experiences one of his companies had with implementing facial recognition technology. “We walked into Uzinfocom and they already had that running. They have an entire building operational with face ID used every single day. That interaction showed us that the skillset exists there,” Oloko said. While lower costs are a factor in companies selecting Uzbekistan, so is the government’s commitment to developing the IT sector. “We are actively engaged with the Uzbek government where there is a lot of appetite to digitalise and to integrate with the rest of the technology world. Over the last six or seven years the country has been among the global front runners of digitalisation,” Kadirov said. The World Bank is committed to supporting the development of the Uzbek digital economy and broadening access to digital skills and employment opportunities in information technology-enabled services for young people in rural and remote locations, and last week granted a 50 million US dollars concessional loan to implement the Uzbekistan Digital Inclusion Project. According to the 2030 National Development Strategy, by 2030, Uzbekistan plans to become a Central Asian IT hub, increase the annual volume of IT exports to five billion US dollars, attract 1,000 foreign IT companies to launch operations in the country and provide employment opportunities for 300,000 youths in the IT sector. “Uzbekistan is a very young nation where over 60 per cent of the population is below the age of 30. The best way to provide the opportunities and prospects for this new generation is to provide them with jobs that are in high demand all over the world. They are active, hungry for new knowledge and new skills,” Kadirov added. I saw this firsthand during my visit to the country—just how many initiatives promoting education there are in Uzbekistan, both public and private, and how much demand there is for educational services, language courses and IT-related skills. Even if public universities do not keep up with the demand, the private sector steps in and fills the breach. Several international universities have opened subsidiaries in Uzbekistan, including Westminster University and Webster University. Rohitashwa Aggarwal, Partner, Global Business Advisory and Research at Everest Group, first started looking at Uzbekistan several years ago. “When we look at firms operating in the UK, about a quarter make use of IT talent based in the UK, another quarter is based in Europe, another quarter in India, and the fourth quarter is based throughout the rest of the world,” he said. “The problem is that most of alternatives to India are very small, and you cannot immediately find more than 1,500 people. It takes time. We have been tracking some of these locations that we call the dark horses. Talent, hunger and investment: these are positives that needs to be sustained.” Aggarwal also mentioned that about 40 per cent of buyers in Everest Group’s research indicated cost as their top concern. Considering the wide range of incentives that Uzbekistan’s IT Park has to offer, including the ‘Zero Risk Programme’ which provides rent-free offices, free technical equipment, training grants of up to 5,000 US dollars, and subsidies covering up to 15 per cent of the salaries of 100 employees, Uzbekistan could be a viable alternative. The digital skills gap in the UK is estimated to cost the economy 63 billion UK pounds per year in lost potential GDP and is expected to widen, resulting in a workforce inadequately equipped to meet the demands of the digital age. Employers say that only 48 per cent of people leaving full-time education have the advanced digital skills required, and many companies cite the lack of available talent as the single biggest constraining factor to their growth. According to IT Park Uzbekistan’s data, services exported to the UK by resident companies currently amount to 27 million UK pounds annually. Software development accounts for almost two thirds of that amount, the rest made up by game development business process outsourcing. There is room for growth. “This is my introduction to Uzbekistan. I’m learning about the available talent about the government and investment endorsement, and it’s just phenomenal. But I’ve never received any information about Uzbekistan’s value proposition,” said Kerry Hallard, CEO of the Global Sourcing Association, Founder of the Global Technology and Business Services Council. “I did a presentation six years ago about the Lviv IT Cluster in Ukraine and its biggest problem was that nobody knows its name. Obviously, now everybody knows about Brand Ukraine and what it stands for. I think Uzbekistan has got the same opportunity. The opportunity of building brand Uzbekistan is phenomenal. But you’ve all got to come together and do it collaboratively—every individual, every company, as well as the government,” Hallard added. Kadirov confirmed that a lack of awareness was a key issue in bringing more British partners on board. “Uzbekistan is a sleeping dragon on Asia’s IT landscape,” he added “If Uzbekistan can become one of the default options that executives look at when thinking about where to go next, I would consider that a success,” David Rumble, Director at Maistro Group and Managing Partner at On Consultancy, concluded. ___________________________________________ Unlike many news and information platforms, Emerging Europe is free to read, and always will be. There is no paywall here. We are independent, not affiliated with nor representing any political party or business organisation. We want the very best for emerging Europe, nothing more, nothing less.

      "Three ways to invest in Central Asia’s IT Boom amid rapid digital technology development. Three ways to invest in Central Asia’s IT boom open a path to a region that historically has served as a significant crossroads of civilizations, bridging the gap between the East and the West. While intellectual technology (IT) incurred a setback during the Soviet era, things are changing now. Having a young and exponentially growing population of over 78 million people, Central Asia, comprised of five former Soviet republics — Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan — is seeking to become a global tech force. For the past twenty years, Central Asia’s aggregate gross domestic product (GDP) has increased fourfold in real terms. A 2022 report from the Eurasian Development Bank (EDB) indicated that Central Asia is a region with high development potential in the upcoming years, with its aggregate GDP now standing at about $347 billion. Three ways to invest in Central Asia’s IT boom: Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan Kazakhstan is the leading economy in the region, growing from $18.3 billion in 2000 to $197.1 billion in 2021, followed by Uzbekistan, whose economic reforms are responsible for a long-term significant economic growth of $52 billion (from 2000 till 2021). Kyrgyzstan is seeking to tap its economic potential by using hydroelectric power, Tajikistan is planning to use the potential of its comparatively young demographic to fuel economic development and Turkmenistan is aiming for increased growth by diversifying its economy. Moreover, as of fall 2023, World Bank predictions forecast the region’s GDP strengthening to 4.8% by year-end 2023 and maintaining an average of 4.7% in the next couple of years. One area driving economic growth is the potential for Central Asia to establish itself as a robust digital market, propelled by the exponential increase in internet users across the region. “With Uzbekistan’s government providing tax benefits to businesses, the country might be creating an even better climate for economic development than the established market,” said Sherzod Shermatov, the Minister of Digital Technologies of Uzbekistan. “This is the main message,” Shermatov said. “We want to help you grow your business with us.” Three Ways to Invest in Central Asia’s IT Boom: Digital Silk Road The ancient Silk Road is now becoming a digital one in the present day. At the recent ICT Week Startup Summit, 2023 held in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, leaders from Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan convened to discuss the IT transformation during the “Central Asia’s Emerging Digital Market” panel discussion. Highlighting the recent World Bank report, the discussion’s moderator, Vladimir Norov, co-founder and chairman of the Central Asia Association of Artificial Intelligence, emphasized the role of the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing military attacks by Russia’s forces in Ukraine. These factors have spurred increased investment and engagement by foreign companies to foster expanded development in the region. “When you talk to the attractiveness for foreign investors, we don’t talk about Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, we are talking about the full region; it’s the Central Asia region,” said Abdulahad Kuchkarov, first deputy director of the IT Park Uzbekistan, during the panel. Two countries, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, have been particularly at the forefront of the digital transformation of Central Asia. A report by the Asian Development Bank in 2022 identified six main sectors that would benefit from digital advances, while boosting regional cooperation: health care, education, agriculture, finance, trade and tourism. However, despite the growing regional cooperation, a lack of capital investment remains a challenge for the countries. Nonetheless, according to the Uzbekistan Institute of Macroeconomic and Regional Studies, regional cooperation increased 1.3 times over five years (2017-2021). These sustained joint investment efforts triggered regional growth and resulted in enhanced investment flows. Three Ways to Invest in Central Asia’s IT boom: 5%-Plus GDP Moreover, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in its latest Regional Economic Prospects (REP) reported forecasts of 5.7% GDP growth in Central Asia in 2023, with annual growth of 5.9% in 2024. This growth is primarily driven by international trade, China’s economic reopening and increased government spending. The strong focus on regional cooperation is expected to offer more investment opportunities in the future, allowing investment in international stocks and local stock exchanges to capitalize on Central Asia’s burgeoning IT boom amid growing digital technology developments. Here are the three ways to invest in Central Asia’s IT boom amid rapid digital technology development. First of Three Ways to Invest in Central Asia’s IT Boom: EPAM Systems Inc. The first way of investing in the region is through EPAM Systems Inc. (NYSE: EPAM), which is establishing a growing presence in the Central Asian market. EPAM Systems Inc., founded in 1993 and headquartered in Newtown, Pennsylvania, provides digital software product development and platform engineering services worldwide in over 50 countries with 55,600+ clients. Within the scope of information technology, these services specifically include Software Product Development, Custom Application Development, Application Testing, Enterprise Application Platforms, Application Maintenance, and Support and Infrastructure Management. These services are primarily offered as solutions in financial services, travel and consumer, software and high technology, life sciences and health care. The overall focus is on innovative and scalable software solutions. The company operates in three central regions: the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia-Pacific (APAC). Within EMEA, EPAM Systems has offices in Uzbekistan (Tashkent) and Kazakhstan (Almaty, Astana and Karaganda). Moreover, EPAM Systems employs 59,300 people and has amassed a total revenue of $4.84 million in the past 12 months. Three Ways to Invest in Central Asia’s IT Boom: Undervalued Stock EPAM Systems, a global digital transformation services and product engineering company, looks to be an undervalued stock with a market capitalization of $15.875 billion, as of December 2023. Meanwhile, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio) is at 34.26, with a 52-week range of $197.99 – $385.96 (Yahoo Finance). As for EPAM’s profitability, the Stock Rover financial service estimates five-year earnings per share (EPS) growth of 4.9%, as well as 4.3% sales growth in the next year. That makes the stock a good buy at the moment. The third-quarter earnings report released on Nov. 2, 2023, showed better-than-expected results. Despite the decline in revenue by 6.1% year-over-year, the company recorded an increase in revenues from the EMEA region by 1.8% year over year. The overall rating of the stock vs. its peers, according to Stock Rover, is 98/100, with valuation (89), efficiency (92) and financial strength (96) scoring exceptionally high. The stock received lower ratings of 53 out of 100 for growth and 79 of 100 for momentum. The year-to-date (YTD) S&P 500 returns on the stock showed 21.7%, as of December 12, 2023. Out of 15 analysts who track EPAM Systems, Stock Rover reported that seven called the stock a strong buy, while six rated it as a hold, making the consensus analyst rating a buy. EPAM Systems Inc. competes with other companies like Virginia-based Dxc Technology Company (NYSE: DXC), New York-based Kyndryl Holdings Inc. (NYSE: KD), and Virginia-based CACI International Inc. (NYSE: CACI). On Oct. 31, 2023, EPAM signed a strategic collaboration agreement with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to expand its club engineering capabilities and help its clients scale up cloud-native development to find solutions to business challenges using artificial intelligence (AI). Source: StockCharts.com Second of Three Ways to Invest in Central Asia’s IT Boom: TBC Bank The second way of investing in the region is through TBC Bank, which is traded on the London Stock Exchange and is establishing a growing presence in the Central Asian market. TBC Bank Group PLC (LSE: TBCG.L), a London-based banking group founded in 1992 and previously headquartered in Tbilisi, Georgia, provides banking, leasing, brokerage, insurance and card processing services to individual and corporate customers in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan. The company operates in many segments, including corporate, micro, small and medium enterprises, corporate centers and others, with retail making most of the company’s revenues. Additionally, TBC Bank is also a provider of internet, mobile, remote, SMS banking and wallet-related services. The company employs approximately 10,700 employees worldwide and has a market capitalization of $1.548 billion with a P/E ratio of 5.01, as of December 2023 (Yahoo Finance). The total sales of the company reached $965 million over the past 12 months. The stock’s 52-week range spanned $2,055.00 – $3,095.00, as of December 12, 2023 (Yahoo Finance). According to Stock Rover, the stock seems promising in growth, scoring 95/100 with sales five-year average rising 18.9%. The stock is also profitable, given its score of 85/100 with a net margin of 44.0%. Furthermore, the dividend yield of this stock is 8.1%. According to Simply Wall St, the company currently is trading 40.6% below its estimated fair value and its earnings are forecast to grow 16.03% per year, after gaining 23% during the past five years. The main competitors of the company are Japan-based Yamaguchi Financial Group Inc. (OTC: YFGSF), Cyprus-based Bank of Cyprus Holdings Public Limited Company (OTC: BKCYF) and Indonesia-based PT BankBTPN Tbk (OTC: BTPNF). As far as its price-to-earnings ratio vs. peers, TBC Bank appears to be a good value. TBC Bank has a P/E ratio of 4.8x, compared to its peers who average 7.7x. TBC Bank has made a significant impact in Central Asia in recent years. In Uzbekistan, it has attracted $28.1 million in capital from shareholders. This investment was created with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and TBC Bank Group PLC. The investment was directed towards TBC Bank Uzbekistan (TBC UZ), aimed at bolstering TBC UZ’s position in the local banking market and contributing to the digitalization of the country’s banking sector. The bank also started investing in Uzbekistan’s IT sector, which has been booming over the past seven years. For instance, it acquired a 51% stake in Payme, a payment service provider, for $5.5 million, making it the most significant investment in IT companies in Uzbekistan. More recently, TBC Bank launched a feature to enable accepting international online transfers, according to spot.uz. These are just a few examples of how the bank expands its regional reach and operations. Source: StockCharts.com Third of Three Ways to Invest in Central Asia’s IT Boom: Open a Brokerage Account The third way to invest in the region is by opening a brokerage account, allowing investors to buy shares on the local Uzbek stock exchange and other regional stock exchanges. Uzbek Commodity Exchange (UzEx), located in the capital of Tashkent, Uzbekistan, is the biggest trading platform in the Central Asia region. It has an extensive trade infrastructure of 13 branches in various regional centers with more than 100 trading platforms and 7,000 brokerages providing stock services for global investors. “Privatization is happening both through the public markets via IPOs and through strategic sales,” said Quinn Martin, president of the New York-based Bluestone Investment Bank that focuses on Central Asia. However, the Uzbekistan government recently abandoned its proposed plan of selling 2% of state-owned companies through initial public offerings (IPOs). Under that plan, Uzbekistan intended to offer investors a chance to buy up to 2% of the shares in companies that the government planned to privatize through a public auction on a local stock exchange. An IPO of Uzbekneftegaz, an integrated natural gas and liquid hydrocarbons producer in the Central Asian nation, and 39 other state-owned enterprises were approved in a March 24 decree by the President of Uzbekistan, but the innovative idea later was dropped. Such a privatization could have led to complications, since offering just 2% of selected state-owned companies in IPOs may have caused those shares to become highly illiquid in the secondary market. A small local public offering may have inadvertently set a low benchmark price and hurt the prospects of a larger international listing in the future. American investors can gain exposure to Uzbekistan by investing in Asia Frontier Capital’s Uzbekistan Fund (AFC Uzbekistan Fund), managed by its Chief Investment Officer Scott Osheroff, which has delivered 78.52% growth since its inception in 2019. Direct trading for foreign investors can be done by opening a Uzbek brokerage account with a locally licensed investment bank like Bluestone and others. The AFC Uzbekistan Fund’s strategy is to offer high returns for investors from growth in the equities market. In the long term, the fund wants to capture value in listed growth companies in 5-7 years to achieve capital appreciation. The goal is to focus on private companies and government privatizations. Third of Three Ways to Invest in Central Asia’s IT Boom: CONCLUSION Central Asia is experiencing remarkable growth. Just a few years ago, this region remained largely unknown to the world, but it now aims to establish itself as a central hub for digitalization and technology in the future. Factors such as exponential demographic growth, an intensified focus on English education, growing opportunities in private education, and a surging IT outsourcing sector contribute to the region’s potential as a highly attractive investment destination. “The demographics are mind-blowing,” Martin said. “More babies were born here last year than in the UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark combined. The word is out that everyone needs to learn English. The opportunities in private education are immense.” Amid escalating global investments, the former Silk Road countries are actively working to attract more investors from the region and abroad. They are forging partnerships and offering opportunities on both local and international stock exchanges in a bid to enhance their appeal and foster increased investment. “Uzbekistan is in the early days of a 10- or 20-year boom cycle,” Martin said. “Buckle up.” Three ways to invest and profit from Central Asia’s IT boom include EPAM Systems, TBC Bank and opening a local brokerage account.

      "Over the past few weeks, I have been given an inside look at how Uzbekistan is developing its IT sector. In short, the state — via the Ministry of Information Technologies and IT Park, which sits within this ministry — is leading the creation of an IT outsourcing industry by offering a range of subsidies and incentives. IT Park was created in 2018, and today ‘residents’ of IT Park benefit from a range of generous incentives. These include 0% corporate, social and property tax and VAT, a reduced personal income tax rate of 7.5%. Companies that participate in IT Park’s “Zero Risk” program receive free office space in the regions for up to a year, up to 15% of employee salaries paid for, reimbursement of a portion of HR expenses, free technical equipment for as many as 100 employees and up to $5,000 in grants for staff trainings. The Ministry of Information Technologies and IT Park teams are perpetually on the road, meeting with prospective resident companies and partners across the North America, Europe, the Middle East and elsewhere. Just in the last few months they have hit Washington, New York, Austin, San Francisco, London, Amsterdam and Dublin. In October, the Ministry of Information Technologies and IT Park teamed up to host a spectacular series of events highlighting Uzbekistan’s success as an IT outsourcing hub under the banner of ICT Week. The event brought together thousands of local IT professionals, dozens of international companies that are outsourcing IT services to Uzbekistan, and media from more than 10 countries. The four key events of the week were the Uzbekistan Outsourcing Forum, the Startup Summit, the EBRD Star Venture Summit and the Uzbekistan-Korea ICT Business Partnership Forum. It’s a state-led effort to create a new industry, and it’s working. Uzbekistan has grown its IT outsourcing industry from essentially zero a few years ago to a forecast of $300m+ this year. For a small economy, with a GDP of about $80b, creating a brand-new industry that generates that much revenue — dollar revenue at that — is a significant accomplishment. The government hopes it can grow IT exports to at least $5b by 2030. Uzbekistan has a very young population, with an average age of 29. Moreover, this population is growing rapidly. This year nearly a million babies will be born in Uzbekistan, more than in the UK, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark combined. More than 25,000 students graduate from university annually. All of these young people need jobs. Uzbekistan has a number of robust industries that generate employment, notably manufacturing, mining and agriculture. But with the country’s population boom, new industries will need to emerge, particularly those that generate dollar revenue. The state has chosen tourism and IT as two of those key new sectors. I’m a capitalist. And I have seen the failure of state-led economies time and time again since I first arrived in the former Soviet Union in the mid-1990s. Like many professionals working in New Uzbekistan, I had hoped that the country was on the path toward large-scale privatization, getting the state out of its dominant role in the economy and letting Adam Smith’s invisible hand do its thing. Over the last few years, however, it’s become clear that the Uzbek government intends to maintain its central role in the economy. Selected assets will be privatized and foreign investors will be welcomed and their rights protected. But the core economic model is state-led and its quasi-capitalism. For the rapidly emerging IT industry, this model seems to be working. Quinn Martin is co-founder and president of Bluestone, an American investment banking firm focused on Central Asia.

      "In recent years, Uzbekistan has strategically positioned itself as a key player in the regional IT landscape, a move that has garnered considerable attention from the public. Earlier, we presented articles from international media covering the outcomes of the \"ICTWEEK  Uzbekistan - 2023” held in October this year. Andrew Wrobel, managing partner at Emerging Europe, recently shared his impressions after attending a conference in the UK. The event focused on the theme \"Uzbekistan - the new outsourcing hub in Central Asia,\" capturing the attention of both local and international IT experts. The article provides a comprehensive overview of the potential within Uzbekistan's burgeoning IT sector and its efforts to attract UK buyers and investors. Wrobel emphasizes Uzbekistan's historical roots in software development, dating back to the 1980s, with a significant boost after gaining independence. The government's role as a major buyer of software solutions post-independence laid the foundation for the sector's development, as noted by Abdukarim Kadirov from Realsoft. The article underlines the lower costs in Uzbekistan as a factor attracting companies, while also spotlighting the government's active engagement in fostering the IT sector. The commentary from Rohitashwa Aggarwal of Everest Group adds a global perspective, emphasizing the need to sustain the positive factors of talent, hunger, and investment in emerging locations like Uzbekistan. “When we look at firms operating in the UK, about a quarter make use of IT talent based in the UK, another quarter is based in Europe, another quarter in India, and the fourth quarter is based throughout the rest of the world,” he said. The article effectively communicates the opportunities and challenges within Uzbekistan's IT sector, making a compelling case for increased collaboration and investment. It successfully navigates through historical context, current initiatives, and future aspirations, providing a well-rounded understanding of the landscape.

      "Over the past few years since the establishment of IT Park and the country’s commitment to digitization, the IT industry in Uzbekistan has evolved into a key driver of economic development. Today, as part of the “Digital Uzbekistan 2030” strategy, the republic sets ambitious goals for comprehensive digital transformation, with the primary objective of the IT sector being the increase of IT services export to $5 billion annually. To achieve this, favorable conditions are being created in the country to attract foreign companies and prepare qualified professionals. Special government-supported programs, along with various incentives and preferences, are being implemented to support IT companies. Growing market volume and export diversification The IT sector of Uzbekistan is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth, with over 100,000 individuals employed in this industry, and the market volume approaching the $1 billion mark. The export volume of IT services for the first 9 months of 2023 reached $238.7 million, nearly tripling compared to the corresponding period last year ($89.2 million). By the end of the year, this figure is expected to surpass $300 million. Both the geography and structure of IT service exports are undergoing notable changes. While in 2022, 78% of IT service exports were directed to the United States, the current distribution is as follows: In terms of service distribution, in 2022, over half of IT service exports were attributed to BPO, the current distribution is as follows: Such diversification allows the IT sector to avoid dependency on a single country or direction. The prominence of software development as the primary sector indicates the emergence of a larger pool of qualified professionals in the country. Furthermore, software development opens up substantial opportunities and potential, considering the global development market is valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Infrastructure and IT education Key factors contributing to the development of the IT industry and digital transformation in the country include modern IT infrastructure and high-quality IT education aimed at preparing highly skilled professionals. The internet connection bandwidth continually increases, reaching 3200 Gbps by March 2023, with nationwide internet coverage at 99%. Its users amount to 31.1 million people, and Uzbekistan ranks 15th globally in terms of internet affordability. More than10 thousand schools across the country are equipped with high-speed internet. Within the projects like “English speaking nation” and “IT nation”, a digital education ecosystem has been established in the republic, enabling the initiation of one's path into the IT sphere from the school. Approximately 60 IT universities exist in the country. The Tashkent University of Information Technologies, with its six branches in various regions of Uzbekistan, as well as universities like INHA University, Amity University, and others, annually graduate over 29 thousand highly educated professionals in areas such as artificial intelligence, data science, information security, engineering, and more. The number of private educational institutions, residents of IT Park benefiting from state incentives and preferences, has grown to 305. They offer over 400 educational IT courses, which have already passed more than 15,000 people. In collaboration with EPAM Systems, IT Park University was established, currently educating around 400 students. Almost two-thirds of the country’s 36 million population are individuals under 30, with a high level of literacy and proficiency in foreign languages. For instance, over 5 million young people are proficient in the English language. Meanwhile, the average salary for IT-outsourcing specialists in Uzbekistan starts at $500, proving to be quite attractive for international companies. Business friendly environment: State and IT Park support In recent years, the government of Uzbekistan has implemented several significant reforms aimed at improving the business environment and stimulating economic growth. These include the liberalization of the currency market, tax reform, and simplification of business procedures. Furthermore, the state provides comprehensive support to IT companies. Specifically, the resident status of IT Park confers substantial tax incentives. Non-residents pay corporate tax ranging from 5-12%, while residents are exempt from it. Social tax for non-residents is 12%, whereas for residents, it is 0%. Income tax for non-residents is 12%, and for residents, it is 7.5%. Non-residents are subject to VAT on imported services, whereas residents are not. Thanks to these conditions, as of today, about 1600 companies have obtained the status of IT Park Uzbekistan residents, including 411 with foreign capital participation. Notable organizations among them include East Games, iTransition, Epam Systems, Data Orchestra, AER-CA, Qulix, AMC Bridge, and others. Furthermore, IT Park provides IT visas valid for up to 3 years, facilitating the access to a full range of social services, including healthcare and education in public institutions, on an equal basis with citizens of Uzbekistan, as well as to purchase real estate of any value. IT visas are available to IT sector investors, founders of IT Park resident companies, and IT professionals with an annual income exceeding $30,000. Conclusion In conclusion, it can be noted that the IT market in Uzbekistan continues to demonstrate impressive growth and notable diversification, enhancing its resilience. Particularly noteworthy is the increased share of software development in exports, signaling the emergence of highly skilled professionals and substantial prospects in the global IT market. The country aims to strengthen its position on the global IT stage through the enhancement of IT infrastructure, workforce training programs, governmental business support, and the creation of a business-friendly environment. Tax incentives provided to IT Park residents make Uzbekistan a competitive destination for IT business development, while the introduction of IT visas and social benefits for IT professionals contributes to talent attraction and investment. Overall, it can be affirmed that Uzbekistan’s IT sector is currently in a stage of rapid growth, and perhaps, it is an opportune moment to become a part of it.\n",

      "The Japanese government is looking to reduce its budget next fiscal year for the first time in 12 years, highlighting concerns over the massive public debt of the world’s third-largest economy, a draft of the 2024-25 budget showed. The budget is estimated to come to 112.1 trillion yen ($782 billion), compared with the initial 114.4 trillion yen set out in this fiscal year’s budget. The move reflects the government’s will to restore its tattered public finances and revive a lacklustre economy.   Decades of stop-start fiscal spending and reform have left Japan with the industrial world’s heaviest public debt burden – double the size of its economic output. It is now fighting to achieve an even tougher goal of a balanced budget, excluding new bond sales and debt-servicing costs, by the fiscal year ending in March 2026. Tax revenue for fiscal 2024-25 is estimated to come to 69.6 trillion yen, slightly overshooting this year’s estimate at 69.4 trillion yen, which would be a record amount if corporate profits recover and wage growth spreads. Next year the government plans to forego pay increases to boost defence spending in the first of several years and reduce its 5-trillion-yen emergency budget so as not to squeeze its annual spending. defence spending The government plans to trim new bond issuance for a third straight year, counting on tax revenue growth and spending cuts.

Three of China’s biggest carmakers – MG, BYD and Chery – have been speaking to officials in Mexico about setting up factories in Mexico, while another is discussing building a $12-billion battery plant, according to a report by the FT. the FT   US fears Chinese EVs getting in via ‘back door’ The Biden administration is concerned that Chinese carmakers will try to sidestep the measures in the Inflation Reduction Act – which had curbs to specifically exclude Chinese EVs, batteries and other parts from the North American supply chain – to build cheap EVs in Mexico. “Top members of the Republican-led House Select Committee on China wrote in a recent letter they were worried Chinese companies would use Mexico as a ‘back door’ into their market, the report said. Exports of Chinese vehicles have risen in recent years, because of slowing domestic demand and overcapacity, and are expected to climb by 25% next year to 5.3 million units, China Merchants Bank International has said. Chinese automobiles currently face a 25% levy introduced during the administration of former President Donald Trump and extended by his successor. The US government is debating Trump-era duties on roughly $300 billion of Chinese goods, aiming for early next year to wrap up a long-running review of the tariffs, the paper added.  Clean energy exports also discussed in long review The Biden administration is also considering lowering tariffs on some Chinese consumer products that officials do not see as strategically important, in addition to the potential increases on clean-energy products, the paper said. Foreign automakers including Tesla also use China as a major export hub. Lawmakers have said earlier that US automakers are exporting Chinese-made vehicles to the United States, a sign that current import tariffs are insufficient.

The move, by the world’s most dominant processor of rare earths, stems from an overhaul of a list of technologies deemed key to national security.

      "The disruption to the key Suez Canal trade route linking Europe and North America with Asia, threatens to worsen the global surge in inflation as exporters hunt for alternatives that could prove much longer and expensive. From chartering cargo planes to pairing sea and land transport, exporters are making desperate plans to ensure toys, apparel, tea and auto parts reach retailers. Some 35,000 vessels sail through the Red Sea region annually, moving goods between Europe, the Middle East and Asia, representing about 10% of global GDP, said Corey Ranslem, CEO of British maritime risk advisory and security company Dryad Global.   US retailers including Walmart, Target, Macy’sand Nikedepend on the route to get goods ranging from cotton sheets and electric toothbrushes from India to footwear from China and Sri Lanka. But attacks on vessels in the Red Sea by Iran-backedHouthi militants to show support for Hamas during Israel’swar in Gaza has massively disrupted freight supply chains Container shipping costs have surged, more than tripling in some cases, as companies seek to move goods viaother, often longer, ocean routes.  Pairing air-sea-land routes Alan Baer, CEO of OL USA, has teams advising shipping and logistics clients to prepare for at least 90 days of Red Sea disruptions. “It doesn’t help that it’s Christmas weekend,” said Baer. “We’ll have a quiet period from now until January 2, and then everybody will be frenetic.” Some fast-acting companies are already trying to switch to so-called intermodal transport. That can involve two or more modes of transportation, said Jan Kleine-Lasthues, chief operating officer of airfreight with leading German freight forwarder Hellmann Worldwide Logistics. Hellmann has seen increased demand for combined air and sea routing for consumer goods like apparel as well as electronics and tech items, he said. For example, that could mean goods being transported first by sea to a port in Dubai, where they are then loaded onto planes. “This alternative route allows customers to avoid the danger zone in the Red Sea and the long voyage around the southern tip of Africa,” Kleine-Lasthues told Reuters.  Increasing freight costs While companies moving urgent or critical items might opt to use air freight, the expense means it is not a blanket solution, said Paul Brashier, vice-president of Drayage and Intermodal for supply chain group ITS Logistics. Moving goods by air costs roughly 5 to 15 times more than by sea, where container shipping rates are still low by historical standards, said Brian Bourke, global chief commercial officer at SEKO Logistics. If the time it takes to get goods to shelves doubles, more shippers will switch to air – especially for high value goods like designer clothing and high-end electronics, said Bourke, who has already received queries from customers. Meanwhile, large container ship owners have already begun adding fees, including emergency surcharges, for cargo affected by the Red Sea disruptions. In a customer notice on Wednesday, French shipping group CMA CGM announced fees of $1,575 per 20-foot container, $2,700 per 40-foot container and $3,000 for refrigerated containers and special equipment for cargo traveling to and from Red Sea ports.  Panama Canal drought worsening scenario The timing of the Red Sea security issues compounds difficulties for shippers, said Jeb Clulow, partner in law firm Reed Smith’s transportation industry group. The Panama Canal is struggling withsevere droughtand has slashed the number of ship passages it allows. In addition, there is a race to get goods in transit before Chinese New Year factory closures planned for February 10-17, which can disrupt supplies for a month or longer. severe drought Tailwind Shipping Lines, a subsidiary of German discount supermarket chain Lidl, which transports non-food goods for Lidl as well as goods for third-party customers, said it was shipping goods around the Cape for now. “Our aim is to remain as close to our schedule as possible,” it said. Shipping companies remain in the dark over a new international navy coalition being assembled by the United States aimed at stabilising the area.  Fears of extended crisis A Spanish fashion industry source told Reuters shipping lines were telling customers a lot was riding on the US-led task force and whether it can prevent more attacks and make the route safe again. It is critical that European companies are able to use the Suez Canal again to ensure supplies of clothes from Asia, the industry source said. If there are extended disruptions, the consumer goods sector that supplies the world’s top retailers like Walmart and IKEA will face the biggest impact, S&amp;P Global said in a report. “Under an extended threat you will see the price of fuel and goods into Europe increase substantially because of the increased costs of diverting around Africa which can add roughly 30 days to a transit depending on the arrival port,” Dryad Global’s Ranslem said.

Alibaba Group Wu will take over as chief executive of domestic e-commerce arm Taobao and Tmall Group effective immediately, the company said, boosting his direct control over the group’s core businesses. Wu, who has been Group CEO since September, also took over from previous head Daniel Zhang as the company’s cloud business CEO that month. The latest appointment means Wu now leads the overall group as well as its two most important business divisions – cloud and domestic e-commerce.   Alibaba’s Hong Kong-listed shares were trading 3% higher as of 0630 GMT on Wednesday, and 2.65% up at the close of trading. Trudy Dai, the previous head of the e-commerce units, will turn her focus to managing non-core assets as the group combats slower earnings growth.

      "News that many shipping companies are suspending journeys through the Red Sea, following a spate of attacks by Houthi rebels on vessels in waters near Yemen, is expected to have negative impacts on Chinese car exports to Europe. With multiple Chinese and international vessels now re-routing to sail around the southern tip of Africa, the cost of sending cargo to Europe will rise significantly, logistics experts have said. Vessels leaving Asia will have to travel a further 9,000 kilometres if they have to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, and this could add an additional six to 14 days for cars or other cargo going to Europe, they say.   Shares of Chinese shipping companies surged on Monday after China Ocean Shipping Group (COSCO) and other shippers said they would steer clear of the Red Sea, amid expectations that would boost freight rates. China Ocean Shipping Group (COSCO) Shanghai-based COSCO’s listed unit COSCO Shipping Energy Transportation’s share price shot up by 10%, the exchange-imposed limit, along with shippers such as Fujian Highton Development, Ningbo Ocean Shipping and Shanghai Jinjiang Shipping Group, according to Yicai. Yicai But most appear to have fallen since then on concern that global trade, plus oil and gas cargoes, will be badly disrupted if the crisis persists.    China COSCO Shipping Corp Ltd, which is the fourth largest carrier of containers, suspended journeys through the Red Sea on Monday, while Hong Kong-based Orient Overseas International, Taipei-based Evergreen Marine and Japan’s Ocean Network Express also said they would avoid using the route. These Asian carriers followed announcements earlier this month by Denmark’s Maersk, Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd, France’s CMA CGM and Switzerland’s MSC. They follow a series of attacks since mid-November on vessels seeking to journey through the Suez Canal, which normally handles about 12% of global sea trade.   US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin announced a 10-nation coalition on Monday that aims to deter attacks on vessels by Houthi militants, who have been angered by Israel’s dramatic onslaught on Hamas fighters in the Gaza Strip because of reports that many thousands of civilians have been killed. 10-nation coalition on Monday that aims to deter attacks on vessels However, the Iran-backed Houthis have vowed to continue staging missile and drone attacks on vessels, as well as ship hijacks, until the Israel-Hamas conflict ends.

      "Steep price cuts and bargain hunts are becoming the new norm in China, threatening to tighten the hold of deflation on the world’s second largest economy. Falling income growth and record-high youth unemployment are pushing the average Chinese consumer to buy fewer and cheaper products and services, which, in turn, is forcing retailers in the country to offer lower-priced alternatives. Falling income growth record-high youth unemployment And the fierce competition to draw the attention of thrifty Chinese consumers is reshaping the country’s retail landscape.   The pursuit of “value of money” among consumers “is reversing years of trading up across almost every category,” said Mark Tanner, founder of Shanghai-based marketing agency China Skinny. Discounting and the roll-out of cheaper products has led to a fall in the average selling price for several product categories, including supplements, dairy, skin care and cosmetics, he added. These trends suggest an increasing risk that recent deflationary trends could soon become more permanently entrenched in the Chinese economy.  Advent of discount stores The climate has also given rise to a new breed of discount stores, a relatively new phenomenon for China, which, in turn, is pushing larger rivals to announce big price cuts. Lingshi Henmang is a six-year-old snack brand with the slogan “The People’s Snack”. Its products are cheaper than supermarkets and it plans to expand to 10,000 stores in 2025 from 4,000 currently, according to the Changsha-based company. In a statement released by its public relations representative, Lingshi Henmang said the expansion was a result of strong demand. “The market has undergone significant changes in the past three years due to the epidemic, and consumers are becoming more rational in their purchasing decisions,” the statement said. Bestore, China’s biggest snack brand, in November fought back by cutting prices on average by 22% on 300 products, with the largest at 45%, in its biggest reductions ever. Hotmaxx, which specialises in selling soon-to-expire products at cheaper prices, has also set a target of expanding to 5,000 outlets in the next three years, from 250 currently, according to its website.    A post shared by Asia Financial (@asiafinancial)   Cheaper alternatives on the rise Numerous examples of Chinese retailers offering lower-priced alternatives have appeared in response to consumers’ cost-cutting. Haidilao, China’s largest hotpot restaurant chain known for premium, attentive service, in late September opened two outlets of a lower-priced brand, Hailao Huoguo. Haidilao Huoguo offers beef dishes for as low as 28 yuan ($3.92), down from 70 yuan at the flagship chain. Its food is also served cafeteria-style, reducing staffing costs. Similarly, spirits maker Moutai, whose trademark 500ml baijiu bottles sell at 1,499 yuan ($209.89), this year unveiled latte and chocolate products infused with the liquor that sell for as little as 35 yuan. Walmart’s membership chainSam’s Club and Alibaba’sFreshippo have also been locked in a price war for the past five months. Both sides have cut prices on popular items such as durian puff pastries by up to 34%.  Feeling the heat In some industries, falling consumer appetite is already fuelling a decline in revenue, as “companies are lowering prices to maintain their market share and avoid being squeezed out,” said Wang Dan, a Shanghai-based economist at Hang Seng Bank. “It is definitely a price decrease or low inflation environment now. Though it is hard to forecast how long the situation will last, but for sure it is bad for the economy,” she said. Policymakershave saidthey expect inflation to pick up, but data earlier this month showed consumer prices falling at theirfastestpace in three years and factory gate deflation deepening. theirfastestpace in three years At such a time, companies ramping up cheaper offerings may create a vicious cycle of lower profit margins that curtail wage and job growth and further depress consumer appetite.

      "A Singapore-based startup is tapping artificial intelligence (AI) to hunt for reserves of critical minerals, betting that the technology can help it reduce the cost and time spent in mining. The firm, Atomionics, has used gravity and AI to develop a “virtual drill” technology called Gravio that can define ore bodies and improve the efficiency of minerals projects. Atomionics Drilling a single hole to search for a mineral can cost from $7,000 to $33,000. A lithium miner might need as many as 400 holes to prove up a resource, so building a more accurate virtual picture before drilling can slash costs.   “The key challenge is that sometimes (drill holes) don’t actually hit the reserve,” Atomionics CEO Sahil Tapiawala said. The company aims to cut these “empty” samples by at least half, he added. Like many exploration technologies, Atomionics taps the gravity signatures of different minerals to pinpoint where they lie beneath the earth. It is able to do so more precisely than typical air-based survey techniques, and processes data in real time using AI, speeding up the work of defining ore bodies, Tapiawala said.  Costly critical minerals exploration The mining industry uses various techniques to find minerals, including ground-penetrating radar and aeromagnetic surveys, but no one method guarantees success. KoBold Metals, a California-based startup whose backers include billionaires Bill Gates and Jeff Bezos, is also using AI to search for metals such as lithium. KoBold Metals “The energy industry would traditionally defer to seismic data before undertaking any drilling project,” Cameron Fink, Bridgeport Energy exploration manager, said in a statement. “With further development, Gravio can present as a low-cost alternative to traditional methods of exploration.”  First customers in Australia, US Atomionics has signed contracts with three major mining companies as part of a strategy to pinpoint ore bodies of metals key to the energy transition, Tapiawala said. That would add to work the firm was already doing in Queensland state with New Hope unit Bridgeport Energy. Bridgeport Energy The mining majors are expected to finish collecting and analysing data using Gravio early next year. “We are actively deploying for critical minerals, so specifically copper, nickel, zinc,” Tapiawala said, adding the technology was being rolled out in Australia and the US. He declined to identify the miners for reasons of commercial confidentiality. The privately-held firm is backed by a number of Singapore-based government agencies and strategic investors.

      "Original content: Chinese state-backed hackers have been experimenting with OpenAI’s generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to gain information on their rivals, the technology firm’s key backer Microsoft has said. The US software giant said state-backed hackers from North Korea, Iran and Russia had also been using OpenAI’s tools to hone their skills and trick their targets. The company announced the finding as it rolled out a blanket ban on state-backed hacking groups using its AI products on Wednesday.   “Independent of whether there’s any violation of the law or any violation of terms of service, we just don’t want those actors that we’ve identified – that we track and know are threat actors of various kinds – we don’t want them to have access to this technology,” Microsoft Vice President for Customer Security Tom Burt said. In a blog post, Microsoft said it had tracked hacking groups affiliated with Russian military intelligence, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, and the Chinese and North Korean governments using large language models (LLMs). In a blog post “We really saw them just using this technology like any other user,” Microsoft’s Burt said. Chinese state-backed hackers used LLMs to seek information on “global intelligence agencies, domestic concerns, notable individuals, cybersecurity matters, topics of strategic interest, and various threat actors,” Microsoft noted in its blog. They also used LLMs to develop code “with potential malicious intent” and translate computing terms and technical papers, the tech giant said. China’s US embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said it opposed “groundless smears and accusations against China” and advocated for the “safe, reliable and controllable” deployment of AI technology to “enhance the common well-being of all mankind.”  Russia hackers focus on Ukraine; North Korea on phishing The allegation that state-backed hackers have been caught using AI tools to help boost their spying capabilities is likely to underline concerns about the rapid proliferation of the technology and its potential for abuse. Senior cybersecurity officials in the West have been warning since last year thatrogue actors were abusing such tools, although specifics have, until now, been thin on the ground. have been warning since last year “This is one of the first, if not the first, instances of a AI company coming out and discussing publicly how cybersecurity threat actors use AI technologies,” said Bob Rotsted, who leads cybersecurity threat intelligence at OpenAI. OpenAI and Microsoft described the hackers’ use of their AI tools as “early-stage” and “incremental.” Burt said neither had seen cyber spies make any breakthroughs. Hackers alleged to working on behalf of Russia military spy agency, widely known as the GRU, used the models to research “various satellite and radar technologies that may pertain to conventional military operations in Ukraine,” Microsoft said. North Korean hackers, meanwhile, used the models to generate content “that would likely be for use in spear-phishing campaigns” against regional experts, the firm said.  Iran hackers targeted feminists Iranian hackers also leaned on the models to write more convincing emails, Microsoft said, at one point using them to draft a message attempting to lure “prominent feminists” to a booby-trapped website. They also tried to use large language models to develop code to evade detection. Microsoft raised the alarm on Iranian hackers’ use of AI earlier this month too. In a blog last week, the tech firm noted that state-backed Iranian hackers had, in December, succeeded in interrupting streaming television services and replacing them with “a fake news video featuring an apparently AI-generated news anchor.” In a blog last week France24 reported on Tuesday that affected services included British public broadcaster BBC and “a host of other European TV streaming services.” France24 reported Microsoft said its objective in releasing the report was “to ensure the safe and responsible use of AI technologies like ChatGPT.” But neither Burt nor Rotsted commented on the volume of activity or how many accounts had been suspended. Burt, meanwhile, defended the zero-tolerance ban on hacking groups – which doesn’t extend to Microsoft offerings such as its search engine, Bing – by pointing to the novelty of AI and the concern over its deployment. “This technology is both new and incredibly powerful,” he said.

      "Original content: Most Asian shares dropped on Wednesday, following the overnight fall on Wall Street, as traders scaled back bets on the pace and scale of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve this year. The shift in rate expectations came after US inflation data on Tuesday came through bigger than expected, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising 3.1% on an annual basis, above forecasts for a 2.9% increase. Futures now point to about 87 basis points of easing priced in for the Fed this year, as compared to 110 bps prior to the data release and 160 bps at the end of last year. That kept pressure on global stocks, which had rallied strongly towards the end of last year on aggressive bets for rate cuts by major central banks globally in 2024.   MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8% in early Asia trade and was headed for a fifth straight day of losses. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were trading near flat. EUROSTOXX 50 futureslost 0.3%. “The stronger data pushes back on the hope of a rate cut from the Federal Reserve any time soon,” Daniela Hathorn, a senior market analyst at Capital.com said. “We’ll likely have to wait for the second half of the year for the Fed to start cutting, but the issue isn’t so much whether the bank will cut rates this year, as that is an almost certainty at this point, but how many rate cuts there will be.”  Nikkei drops, but Hang Seng edges up Even Japan’s standout Nikkeiwas not spared from the beating and fell 0.7%, after gaining 2.9% in the previous session and topping the 38,000 level. The recent move higher in the Nikkei was helped in part by a sliding yen, which had weakened past the key 150 per dollar level for the first time this year on Tuesday.The yen last stood at 150.63 per dollar. Japan’s top currency officials warned on Wednesday against what they described as rapid and speculative yen moves overnight. Elsewhere, stocks in Hong Kong fell 1.8% at the start of their first trading day following the Lunar New Year break, but the Hang Seng Index managed to rise and closed up 0.8%. The index gained 1.4% last week but is down 7% so far in 2024 after dropping nearly 14% last year. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Indexwas up 1.6%, while Hong Kong-listed Chinese tech firms rose 2.5%. Just before the break, China replaced the head of its market regulator with a securities regulator veteran who has led the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is known for his tough line on market malpractice. China replaced the head of its market regulator Chinese authorities have announced a raft of measures to aid its stock market after domestic stocks plunged to five-year lows earlier this month. So far, the moves – which include curbs on short selling and state fund Central Huijin Investment’s expanded stock buying – have failed to turn investor sentiment around. Market sentiment remains somewhat sceptical on Chinese equities, with valuations appearing attractive compared to historical levels and against broader global markets, William Fong, head of Hong Kong and China equities at Barings, said. Markets on the mainland remain closed this week for the Lunar New Year break.   Meanwhile, Indian shares rebounded in the final two hours of trade on Wednesday, led by a jump in public sector enterprises on the back of comfortable valuations while a drop in IT stocks after hot US inflation data capped the gains. The NSE Nifty 50 index rose 0.45% to 21,840.05, while the S&amp;P BSE Sensex settled 0.39% higher at 71,833.17.  Rates likely higher for longer The prospect that US rates are likely to stay elevated for longer than initially expected pushed the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield to an over two-month high of 4.3320% on Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which typically reflects near-term interest rate expectations, last stood at 4.6324%, having similarly scaled a two-month top of 4.6730% in the previous session. That’s helped the greenback firm near a three-month peak against a basket of currencies at 104.81. The dollar index hit its strongest level since November on Tuesday. Sterling steadied at $1.2597.UK inflation data is due later on Wednesday. In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin retreated from the $50,000 level and last bought $49,496. Oil prices meanwhile edged lower, reversing some of Tuesday’s gains as geopolitical tensions lingered in the Middle East and eastern Europe. US crude fell 22 cents to $77.65 a barrel. Brent futureseased 33 cents to $82.44.  Reuters with additional editing by Jim Pollard        Jim Pollard is an Australian journalist based in Thailand since 1999.

      "Original content: Japan slipped into a recession at the end of last year, an unexpected outcome that has raised questions on when the central bank will end its decade-long policy of monetary stimulus. Government data released on Thursday showed that gross domestic product (GDP) fell by an annualised 0.4% in the October-December period after a 3.3% slump in the previous quarter. Two consecutive quarters of contraction are typically considered the definition of a technical recession.   After forecasts of a 1.4% increase, the data came as a shock, while the country lost its title as the world’s third-biggest economy to Germany. And with sluggish consumption, weak demand in China and production halts at a unit of Toyota Motor Corp, some analysts say there could be a further contraction in the current quarter. production halts at a unit of Toyota “What’s particularly striking is the sluggishness in consumption and capital expenditure that are key pillars of domestic demand,” Yoshiki Shinke, a senior executive economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said. “The economy will continue to lack momentum for the time being with no key drivers of growth.” While many analysts still expect the Bank of Japan to phase out its massive monetary stimulus this year, the weak data may cast doubt on its forecast that rising wages will underpin consumption and keep inflation durably around its 2% target. “Two consecutive declines in GDP and three consecutive declines in domestic demand are bad news, even if revisions may change the final numbers at the margin,” Stephan Angrick, senior economist at Moody’s Analytics, said. “This makes it harder for the central bank to justify a rate hike, let alone a series of hikes.”  ‘Consumption soft because of rising prices’ Economy minister Yoshitaka Shindo stressed the need to achieve solid wage growth to underpin consumption, which he described as “lacking momentum” due to rising prices. “Our understanding is that the BOJ looks comprehensively at various data, including consumption, and risks to the economy in guiding monetary policy,” he told a news conference after the data’s release, when asked about the impact on BOJ policy. The yen was steady following the release of the data and last stood at 150.22 per dollar, pinned near a three-month low hit earlier in the week. The Nikkei rose 0.8%, reversing some of its losses made from the previous session, possibly on expectations the BOJ may continue with its massive easing programme for longer than expected. the BOJ On a quarterly basis, GDP slid 0.1% against median forecasts of a 0.3% gain, and compared with a 0.8% contraction in the previous quarter. Private consumption, which makes up more than half of economic activity, fell 0.2%, weaker than a market forecast for a 0.1% gain, as rising living costs and warm weather discouraged households from dining out and buying winter clothes. Capital expenditure, another key private-sector growth engine, fell 0.1%, compared with forecasts of a 0.3% gain, as supply constraints delayed construction projects. External demand, or exports minus imports, contributed 0.2 percentage point to GDP as exports rose 2.6% from the previous quarter, the data showed.  Ending ultra-loose policy ‘still possible’ in April The BOJ has been laying the groundwork to end negative rates by April and overhaul other parts of its ultra-loose monetary framework, but is likely to go slow on any subsequent policy tightening amid lingering risks, sources have told Reuters. While BOJ officials have not offered clues on when exactly they could end negative rates, many market players expect such an action to happen either in March or April. A Reuters poll taken in January showed April as the top choice among economists for the negative rate policy to be abandoned. Some analysts say Japan’s tight labour market and robust corporate spending plans are keeping alive the chance of an early exit from ultra-loose policy. “While the second consecutive contraction in GDP in Q4 would suggest that Japan’s economy is now in recession, business surveys and the labour market tell a different story. Either way, growth is set to remain sluggish this year as the household savings rate has turned negative,” said Marcel Thieliant, head of Asia-Pacific at Capital Economics. “The (BOJ) has been arguing that private consumption has ‘continued to increase moderately’ and we suspect that it will continue to strike an optimistic tone at its upcoming meeting in March,” Thieliant said, sticking to his projection the bank will end its negative interest rate policy in April.

      "Original content: Carmaker Stellantis halted production in Russia in April 2022 – but that, according to customs data and two local sources, did not stop Russian operators from teaming up with a Chinese partner last year to start making new versions of Stellantis’ Citroen models. Stellantis In December last year, Russian company Automotive Technologies imported at least 42 car kits for assembling the Citroёn C5 Aircross model at the Kaluga plant, which is still majority-owned by Stellantis, customs records drawn from a commercial trade data provider showed. Russian company Automotive Technologies Manufactured in China, the kits were produced by China’s Dongfeng Motor Group, the data showed. Dongfeng Motor Group   Automotive Technologies was assembling the Citroёn C5 Aircross at the Kaluga factory, according to two employees at different Russian car dealerships. The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because the information is not public. It is not clear if the kits from China contained parts that fall under the scope of Western sanctions on Russia, to which Beijing is not a party, and there is no suggestion from the customs data or sources that Stellantis knew about the imports. Western sanctions on Russia But the findings highlight the lack of control Western companies such as Ikea or Carlsberg now have over their brands after suspending Russian operations or leaving the country after the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. They also demonstrate Moscow’s increasing dependence on Beijing, particularly in the car industry.  Stellantis admits losing control of its entities in Russia In response to Reuters’ findings, Stellantis said it had concluded since December 31, 2023, that it has “lost control of its entities in Russia.” Stellantis said it had recognised a loss of 144 million euros ($154.53 million) as a result, including the loss of 87 million euros of cash and cash equivalents. Chinese state-owned Dongfeng, Russia’s industry and trade ministry and Automotive Technologies did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Russia’s auto industry had been heavily reliant on investment, equipment and parts from overseas, particularly Europe. Stellantis blamed logistical difficulties and the sanctions imposed on Moscow when it halted operations. It owns 70% of the Kaluga plant with the remaining 30% held by Mitsubishi Motors. Prior to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the factory produced Peugeot, Citroen, Opel and Mitsubishi cars with an annual capacity of 125,000 vehicles.  ‘Parallel imports’ scheme Although many foreign carmakers have since left the Russian market, some supplies continue to make their way to the country through a “parallel imports” scheme introduced by Moscow. That allows importers to bring in products from abroad without the trademark owner’s permission. Citroen models continue to be available for sale in Russia, four Russian car dealers said. In December 2023, the Kaluga plant’s operators hosted an official launch for the “production of medium-sized crossovers.” Reuters was not invited. Automotive Technologies, a company registered in Moscow in March 2023 and 100% owned by Galina Dolgolenko, said in December it was assembling a pilot batch of 48 imported cars, ahead of mass production beginning in 2024, but did not name the supplier or model of car. Pavel Bezruchenko, Automotive Technologies’ strategic development director, was quoted in the Russian newspaper Vedomosti in December as saying the company brings in cars from China using parallel imports. Bezruchenko did not answer the phone or reply to messages seeking comment. Two car dealership employees said that Automotive Technologies had informed them that they would be receiving Citroen C5 Aircross models, assembled in Kaluga from imported kits. However, it was not clear whether the cars rolling off the production line would retain the Citroen brand.

      "Original content: A scientist in Switzerland has confirmed the existence of a new third type of magnetism known as alter-magnetism, according to a report by New Scientist, which is different from ferromagnets, such as fridge magnets, which have a strong magnetic field, and anti-ferromagnetism, which was discovered in the 1930s and lacks external fields, but has electrons spinning alternatively up and down. Recently, Juraj Krempasky and colleagues at the Paul Scherrer Institute confirmed the existence of an alter-magnet by measuring the electron structure in a crystal, manganese telluride, that was previously thought to be anti-ferromagnetic, the report said, adding that alter-magnets “contain a blend of properties from different classes of existing magnets, [and] could be used to make high capacity and fast memory devices or new kinds of magnetic computers”, such as boosting the storage on computer hard drives, or to develop spintronic computers that use magnetic spin instead of current to perform measurements and calculations.

      "Original content: Shares of Chinese biotech firm WuXi Biologics and its affiliate WuXi AppTec plunged again on Wednesday after US lawmakers called on the Biden administration to review whether they should face sanctions. WuXi Biologics WuXi AppTec WuXi Biologics fell 15% before clawing some losses to be 9.2% at the close of trading in Hong Kong, while WuXi App tumbled 17% before ending the day at about 3.9% down. The two companies, which have over 50,000 employees between them, have lost billions – and seen their market value nearly halved this year – on concern over negative impacts from geopolitical tensions between the US and China.   In a letter dated Monday February 12 and seen by Reuters, a bipartisan group of lawmakers told Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo that the global pharmaceutical giant’s links to China’s Communist Party and military threatened US national security. The letter, signed by the Republican chair and ranking Democrat member of the House committee on China, Mike Gallagher and Raja Krishnamoorthi, plus Senators Gary Peters and Bill Hagerty, is Congress’ latest effort to highlight what it says are risks posed by China’s biotech leaders. risks posed by China’s biotech leaders Congress has introduced legislation that would restrict federally-funded medical providers from allowing China’s BGI Group, WuXi AppTec and other biotech firms from getting genetic information about Americans. WuXi AppTec did not respond immediately to a request for comment, but has repeatedly said that it is not a national security risk to any country. “We are concerned by a misguided US legislative initiative to target our company without a fair and transparent review of the facts,” WuXi AppTec said previously in a statement still on its website home page.  Signing agreements with US supply chains The four lawmakers – citing public Chinese government documents, Chinese university websites and media articles – outlined what they called WuXi AppTec’s clear military ties, as well as support for China’s policies in Xinjiang, a region where Washington has accused Beijing of committing genocide against Muslim minorities. They said WuXi AppTec had received investment from numerous PLA funds, including the AVIC Military-Civil Integration Selected Hybrid Securities Investment Fund. They also cited a resume for WuXi Biologics CEO Chen Zhisheng, posted in 2018 to a Tsinghua University website, that listed him as a visiting professor at China’s Academy of Military Medical Sciences, which was added to the Commerce Department’s export control list in 2021. “Given WuXi AppTec’s clear ties to the CCP and the PLA and its likely role in enabling the genocide in Xinjiang, we urge your departments to consider the inclusion of WuXi AppTec and its subsidiaries on your respective control lists,” they said in the letter. Those should include sanctions under Treasury’s Non-SDN Chinese Military-Industrial Complex Companies List, the Commerce list restricting US sales to named entities and the Pentagon’s “1260H” list, which carries implicit warnings about US cooperation with certain firms. “WuXi AppTec and WuXi Biologics have obscured their ties to the CCP and PLA and, as a result, are rapidly integrating themselves into US supply chains by signing agreements with prominent US biotech entities,” the lawmakers wrote. The two companies have counted Pfizer, AstraZeneca, GlaxoSmithKline, and US national labs as partners.

      "Original content: Europe’s most valuable technology company, ASML, has warned that the likelihood of any expansion of curbs targeting its exports to China remain business risks for the firm. The Dutch firm noted the growing list of restrictions imposed by the United States, mostly with assent from the Dutch government, in its annual report published on Wednesday. in its annual report “Our ability to deliver technology in certain countries such as China has been and continues to be impacted by our ability to obtain required licenses and approvals,” the report said in a section on geopolitical risks.   “The list of Chinese entities impacted by export control restrictions has increased since 2022… The list of restricted customers and the scope of the restrictions are subject to change,” the company wrote. ASML dominates the market for lithography systems, machines used to help create circuitry in one key step of the chipmaking process. Following a US-led campaign to slow Beijing’s technological and military advances, ASML has been restricted from selling an array of advanced chipmaking tools to Chinese customers. Up until last year, ASML was shipping several high-productivity DUV (Deep Ultraviolet) lithography machines to China, but the Dutch government revoked those licences before the start of 2024. was shipping revoked those licences The changes impact “a small number of customers in China,” ASML noted. The company — the largest supplier of equipment to computer chipmakers — has already been restricted from selling its most advanced chipmaking tools, the EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography machines to China since 2019. It has never sold an EUV tool there.  Risk of retaliatory sanctions As part of the geopolitical risks facing the firm, ASML noted the probability of retaliatory bans affecting its business as well. “The semiconductor industry makes use of (raw) materials that are controlled by certain countries. In the current geopolitical context, we see an increasing risk exposure that these materials may become unavailable or restricted,” ASML said in the annual report. Last year, China imposed curbs on the export of two key chipmaking metals — gallium and germanium — starting August, in measures largely seen as retaliation to Washington’s chip war. imposed curbs For months, China tightly clamped down on exports of both metals, until December, when its exports of both metals recovered sharply. tightly clamped down recovered sharply Even so, multiple Chinese officials have warned that Beijing could impose more retaliatory measures if the US continues to target China’s tech industry. could impose more retaliatory measures  ‘New competitors driven by self-sufficiency’ In 2023, while many chipmakers were slowing orders amid an industry slump, China passed South Korea to become ASML’s second largest market, representing 26.3% of sales, with Taiwan remaining its largest at 29.3%. But the Chinese government is also throwing billions at domestic chipmaking, in a bid for self sufficiency. Chinese president Xi Jinping has, on multiple occasions, called on the tech industry to rev up innovation and reduce dependence on Western supply chains. is also throwing billions at domestic chipmaking Companies such US-sanctioned Huawei and state-backed chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC) have been leading that push, but mostly in the field of chipmaking. have been leading that push Shanghai Micro Electronics Equipment (SMEE) is China’s best known maker of lithography machines. In December last year, Hong Kong media HK01 reported SMEE had successfully developed China’s first 28 nanometre lithography machine. reported While that remains far behind the most cutting edge chipmaking equipment technology — world leader TSMC is working on a process to produce 2nm chips by 2025 — SMEE’s breakthrough is still a potential risk for ASML. a process “We also face competition from new competitors with substantial financial resources, as well as from competitors driven by the ambition of self-sufficiency in the geopolitical context,” ASML noted in its report.    A post shared by Asia Financial (@asiafinancial)   “Furthermore, we face competition from alternative technological solutions or semiconductor manufacturing processes.” The Dutch firm also noted competition from Japanese chip tech giants Canon and Nikon. Both “have substantial financial resources and broad patent portfolios,” it said. Canon is planning to launch a new chipmaking tool this year — one that works like a ‘stamp machine’ and is capable of slashing costs for chip firms.

Indonesians will go to vote on Wednesday, in the world’s largest single-day polling process that will see 18 parties compete.

Over 73 gigawatts (GW) of solar power had been installed in India as of December 2023, but rooftop solar capacity has seen sluggish uptake and is only around 11.08 GW, the report said, noting that officials have said money would be deposited in bank accounts of people who install solar panels and they would be able to sell surplus electricity back to the grid. Other reports said local councils would get incentives to promote the scheme, which Modi said would “lead to more income, smaller power bills, while generating employment.” Modi is seeking as third term as PM in a national election that is due to be held in April and May.

      "Original content: Top Chinese carmaker BYD has begun a feasibility study on whether to set up a production facility in Mexico to export electric vehicles into the United States. The automaker is due to open a factory in Thailand later this year and also looking at plants in Hungary and Brazil. Late last year the Wall Street Journal revealed that US lawmakers had discussions in November on whether to hike tariffs on Chinese cars and consider other ways to stop Chinese firms from exporting vehicles and other products to the US from Mexico.   Nikkei Asia has now said that BYD is in talks about building a plant in Mexico to export cars to the US, saying this was confirmed on Wednesday by the company’s head in Mexico. Nikkei Asia BYD, known for its cheaper models and a more varied lineup, recently overtook Tesla, its biggest rival, to become the world’s top EV maker in terms of sales. overtook Tesla, its biggest rival, to become the world’s top EV maker According to the Nikkei report, BYD is negotiating with officials over terms, including the factory’s location. BYD’s sales are currently concentrated in China, but it is clearly has ambition to expand globally and set up plants in many regions. EVs are reportedly popular in Mexico and the country has a massive automaking sector, with many of the industry’s top global players. It is also tightly integrated with the US car sector. “Overseas production is indispensable for an international brand”, BYD Mexico country manager Zhou Zou told Nikkei. The carmaker’s Mexico office declined to comment to Reuters.

Chinese automakers will “demolish” global rivals without trade barriers Musk’s view is echoed by a leading advocacy group. “The introduction of cheap Chinese autos – which are so inexpensive because they are backed with the power and funding of the Chinese government – to the American market could end up being an extinction-level event for the US auto sector,” according to a forthcoming report by the group Alliance for American Manufacturing.

      "Original content: Unofficial counting after Indonesia’s presidential election on Wednesday had Defence Minister Prabowo Subianto enjoying a strong lead that could see him win in a single round if sustained. Four polling bodies said Prabowo had about 58% of votes, based on ballots counted in a sample of voting stations nationwide. The number of votes they had tallied ranged from about 52% to 67% as of 0912 GMT. Rivals Anies Baswedan and Ganjar Pranowo had about 25% and 17% respectively, according to the independent pollsters that were conducting “quick counts” at the close of voting. Counts by reputable outlets have proven to be accurate in previous elections. An official result is not expected until several weeks after the vote.   The pattern could signal a first round win for Prabowo. To win in a single round, a candidate needs more than 50% of votes cast and 20% of the ballot in half of the country’s provinces. If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff between the top two finishers will be held in June. The contest pits popular former governors Ganjar and Anies against the pre-election frontrunner Prabowo, a former special forces commander feared in the 1990s as a top lieutenant of Indonesia’s late strongman ruler Suharto. “Alhamdulillah (Praise be to God), we hope the election can go in one round,” said Nusron Wahid, secretary of Prabowo’s campaigning team, commenting on the latest quick counts. The world’s biggest single-day election has included nearly 259,000 candidates vying for 20,600 posts across the archipelago of 17,000 islands, but the focus has been firmly on the race to replace President Joko Widodo, whose influence could determine who takes the helm of the world’s third-largest democracy. world’s biggest single-day election The early lead will be a big boost for Prabowo, who has undergone an image rebrand and is contesting his third successive election after twice losing out to the hugely popular Widodo, who cannot run again because of term limits. Jokowi, as the incumbent is known, is tacitly backing and betting on his former rival as a continuity candidate to preserve his legacy, including a role for his son Gibran Rakabuming Raka as Prabowo’s running mate. son Gibran Rakabuming Raka as Prabowo’s running mate Two surveys issued last week gave Prabowo just over 50% support, with Anies and Ganjar 27 and 31 points adrift, respectively, though the quick counts point to a stronger lead. “This is an emphatic result that diminishes prospects for legal challenges and will also provide the Widodo-Prabowo alliance with an element of affirmation from the public for decision-making in the months ahead,” analyst Kevin O’Rourke said. Nonetheless, he added “concerns exist about the prospect of further incursions on democratic norms”.  Deadly riots in 2019 Former Jakarta governor Anies and ex-Central Java governor Ganjar had been trying to woo undecided voters to try to force a runoff in June. “I want to underline that we want honest and fair elections so that it becomes peaceful,” Anies said at a polling station. Deadly riots broke out after the 2019 election, when Prabowo had initially contested Jokowi’s victory. Some 200,000 security personnel are on guard. “So far, the situation is safe, under control,” said National Police Chief Listyo Sigit Prabowo. Anies has campaigned on promises of change and preventing a backsliding in the democratic reforms achieved in the 25 years since the end of Suharto’s authoritarian, kleptocratic rule. Ganjar hails from the Indonesia Democratic Party of Struggle, of which Jokowi is ostensibly a member, and has campaigned largely on continuing the president’s policies, but crucially lacks his endorsement. Before voting, he also called for a clean election so that candidates could accept the result. Hasto Kristiyanto, a senior politician in his campaign team said there had been many reports of alleged cheating in Central Java and East Java and some intimidation. Prabowo said on Wednesday he hoped the “voting process goes well”.
